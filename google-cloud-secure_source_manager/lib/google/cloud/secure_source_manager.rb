      # Create a new client object for SecureSourceManager.
      #
      # By default, this returns an instance of
      # [Google::Cloud::SecureSourceManager::V1::SecureSourceManager::Client](https://cloud.google.com/ruby/docs/reference/google-cloud-secure_source_manager-v1/latest/Google-Cloud-SecureSourceManager-V1-SecureSourceManager-Client)
      # for a gRPC client for version V1 of the API.
      # However, you can specify a different API version by passing it in the
      # `version` parameter. If the SecureSourceManager service is
      # supported by that API version, and the corresponding gem is available, the
      # appropriate versioned client will be returned.
      # You can also specify a different transport by passing `:rest` or `:grpc` in
      # the `transport` parameter.

      # ## About SecureSourceManager
      #
      # Secure Source Manager API
      #
      # Access Secure Source Manager instances, resources, and repositories.
      #
      # This API is split across two servers: the Control Plane and the Data Plane.
      #
      # Data Plane endpoints are hosted directly by your Secure Source Manager
      # instance, so you must connect to your instance's API hostname to access
      # them. The API hostname looks like the following:
      #
      #    https://[instance-id]-[project-number]-api.[location].sourcemanager.dev
      #
      # For example,
      #
      #    https://my-instance-702770452863-api.us-central1.sourcemanager.dev
      #
      # Data Plane endpoints are denoted with **Host: Data Plane**.
      #
      # All other endpoints are found in the normal Cloud API location, namely,
      # `securcesourcemanager.googleapis.com`.
      #
      # @param version [::String, ::Symbol] The API version to connect to. Optional.
      #   Defaults to `:v1`.
      # @param transport [:grpc, :rest] The transport to use. Defaults to `:grpc`.
      # @return [::Object] A client object for the specified version.
      #
