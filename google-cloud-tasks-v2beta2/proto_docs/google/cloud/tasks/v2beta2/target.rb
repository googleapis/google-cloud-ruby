        #     Repeated headers are not supported but a header value can contain commas.
        #
        #     Cloud Tasks sets some headers to default values:

        #     * `User-Agent`: By default, this header is
        #       `"AppEngine-Google; (+http://code.google.com/appengine)"`.
        #       This header can be modified, but Cloud Tasks will append
        #       `"AppEngine-Google; (+http://code.google.com/appengine)"` to the
        #       modified `User-Agent`.
        #

        #     Tasks sets the following headers:
        #
        #     * `Content-Type`: By default, the `Content-Type` header is set to
        #       `"application/octet-stream"`. The default can be overridden by explicitly
        #       setting `Content-Type` to a particular media type when the
        #       {::Google::Cloud::Tasks::V2beta2::CloudTasks::Client#create_task task is created}.
        #       For example, `Content-Type` can be set to `"application/json"`.
        #     * `Content-Length`: This is computed by Cloud Tasks. This value is
        #       output only.   It cannot be changed.
        #
        #     The headers below cannot be set or overridden:
        #
        #     * `Host`
        #     * `X-Google-*`
        #     * `X-AppEngine-*`
        #
        #     In addition, Cloud Tasks sets some headers when the task is dispatched,
        #     such as headers containing information about the task; see
        #     [request
        #     headers](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/taskqueue/push/creating-handlers#reading_request_headers).
        #     These headers are set only when the task is dispatched, so they are not
        #     visible when the task is returned in a Cloud Tasks response.
        #
        #     Although there is no specific limit for the maximum number of headers or
        #     the size, there is a limit on the maximum size of the
        #     {::Google::Cloud::Tasks::V2beta2::Task Task}. For more information, see the
