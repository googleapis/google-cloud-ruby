      # Create a new client object for DlpService.
      #
      # By default, this returns an instance of
      # [Google::Cloud::Dlp::V2::DlpService::Client](https://cloud.google.com/ruby/docs/reference/google-cloud-dlp-v2/latest/Google-Cloud-Dlp-V2-DlpService-Client)
      # for a gRPC client for version V2 of the API.
      # However, you can specify a different API version by passing it in the
      # `version` parameter. If the DlpService service is
      # supported by that API version, and the corresponding gem is available, the
      # appropriate versioned client will be returned.
      # You can also specify a different transport by passing `:rest` or `:grpc` in
      # the `transport` parameter.
      #
      # ## About DlpService
      #
      # The Cloud Data Loss Prevention (DLP) API is a service that allows clients
      # to detect the presence of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and other
      # privacy-sensitive data in user-supplied, unstructured data streams, like text
      # blocks or images.
      # The service also includes methods for sensitive data redaction and
      # scheduling of data scans on Google Cloud Platform based data sets.
      #
      # To learn more about concepts and find how-to guides see
      # https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/.
      #
      # @param version [::String, ::Symbol] The API version to connect to. Optional.

      # @param transport [:grpc, :rest] The transport to use. Defaults to `:grpc`.
      # @return [::Object] A client object for the specified version.
