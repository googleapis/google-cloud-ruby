        # A description of the conditions under which some aspect of your system is
        # considered to be "unhealthy" and the ways to notify people or services about
        # this state. For an overview of alert policies, see
        # [Introduction to Alerting](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/alerts/).
        # @!attribute [rw] name
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Required if the policy exists. The resource name for this policy. The
        #     format is:
        #
        #         projects/[PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER]/alertPolicies/[ALERT_POLICY_ID]
        #
        #     `[ALERT_POLICY_ID]` is assigned by Cloud Monitoring when the policy
        #     is created. When calling the
        #     {::Google::Cloud::Monitoring::V3::AlertPolicyService::Client#create_alert_policy alertPolicies.create}
        #     method, do not include the `name` field in the alerting policy passed as
        #     part of the request.
        # @!attribute [rw] display_name
        #   @return [::String]
        #     A short name or phrase used to identify the policy in dashboards,
        #     notifications, and incidents. To avoid confusion, don't use the same
        #     display name for multiple policies in the same project. The name is
        #     limited to 512 Unicode characters.
        #
        #     The convention for the display_name of a PrometheusQueryLanguageCondition
        #     is "\\{rule group name}/\\{alert name}", where the \\{rule group name} and
        #     \\{alert name} should be taken from the corresponding Prometheus
        #     configuration file. This convention is not enforced.
        #     In any case the display_name is not a unique key of the AlertPolicy.

        #     to help responders understand, mitigate, escalate, and correct the
        #     underlying problems detected by the alerting policy. Notification channels
        #     that have limited capacity might not show this documentation.

        #     dashes. Keys must begin with a letter.

        #     names](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/data_model/#metric-names-and-labels),
        #     whereas Prometheus \\{rule group} is an unrestricted UTF-8 string.
        #     This means that they cannot be stored as-is in user labels, because
        #     they may contain characters that are not allowed in user-label values.
