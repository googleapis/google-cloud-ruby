        # A set of (label, value) pairs that were removed from a Distribution
        # time series during aggregation and then added as an attachment to a
        # Distribution.Exemplar.
        #
        # The full label set for the exemplars is constructed by using the dropped
        # pairs in combination with the label values that remain on the aggregated
        # Distribution time series. The constructed full label set can be used to
        # identify the specific entity, such as the instance or job, which might be
        # contributing to a long-tail. However, with dropped labels, the storage
        # requirements are reduced because only the aggregated distribution values for
        # a large group of time series are stored.
        #
        # Note that there are no guarantees on ordering of the labels from
        # exemplar-to-exemplar and from distribution-to-distribution in the same
        # stream, and there may be duplicates.  It is up to clients to resolve any
        # ambiguities.
