        # check is a piece of configuration that determines which resources and

        # configured interactively by navigating to the [Cloud console]
        # (https://console.cloud.google.com), selecting the appropriate project,
        # clicking on "Monitoring" on the left-hand side to navigate to Cloud
        # Monitoring, and then clicking on "Uptime".
