        #
        # A group is a named filter that is used to identify
        # a collection of monitored resources. Groups are typically used to
        # mirror the physical and/or logical topology of the environment.
        # Because group membership is computed dynamically, monitored
        # resources that are started in the future are automatically placed
        # in matching groups. By using a group to name monitored resources in,
        # for example, an alert policy, the target of that alert policy is
        # updated automatically as monitored resources are added and removed
        # from the infrastructure.
