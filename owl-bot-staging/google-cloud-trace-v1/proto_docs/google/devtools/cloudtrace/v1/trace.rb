        #         span starts with `NAME_PREFIX`.

        #         exactly `NAME`.
        #     *   `span:NAME_PREFIX`: Return traces where any span starts with
        #         `NAME_PREFIX`.
        #     *   `+span:NAME`: Return traces where any span's name is exactly
        #         `NAME`.
        #     *   `latency:DURATION`: Return traces whose overall latency is
        #         greater or equal to than `DURATION`. Accepted units are nanoseconds
        #         (`ns`), milliseconds (`ms`), and seconds (`s`). Default is `ms`. For
        #         example, `latency:24ms` returns traces whose overall latency
        #         is greater than or equal to 24 milliseconds.
        #     *   `label:LABEL_KEY`: Return all traces containing the specified
        #         label key (exact match, case-sensitive) regardless of the key:value
        #         pair's value (including empty values).
        #     *   `LABEL_KEY:VALUE_PREFIX`: Return all traces containing the specified
        #         label key (exact match, case-sensitive) whose value starts with
        #         `VALUE_PREFIX`. Both a key and a value must be specified.
        #     *   `+LABEL_KEY:VALUE`: Return all traces containing a key:value pair
        #         exactly matching the specified text. Both a key and a value must be
        #         specified.
        #     *   `method:VALUE`: Equivalent to `/http/method:VALUE`.
