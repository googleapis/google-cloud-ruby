For some languages, you can use OpenCensus, a set of open source tracing and stats instrumentation libraries that work with multiple backends. Note that google-cloud-trace-v1 is a version-specific client library. For most uses, we recommend installing the main client library google-cloud-trace instead. See the readme for more details.",
