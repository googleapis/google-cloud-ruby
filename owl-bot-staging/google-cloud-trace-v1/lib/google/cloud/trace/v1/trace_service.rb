        # This file describes an API for collecting and viewing traces and spans
        # within a trace.  A Trace is a collection of spans corresponding to a single
        # operation or set of operations for an application. A span is an individual
        # timed event which forms a node of the trace tree. Spans for a single trace
        # may span multiple services.
        #
        # To load this service and instantiate a client:
        #
        #     require "google/cloud/trace/v1/trace_service"
        #     client = ::Google::Cloud::Trace::V1::TraceService::Client.new
