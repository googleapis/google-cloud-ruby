            # Google Cloud Memorystore for Redis Cluster
            #
            # The `redis.googleapis.com` service implements the Google Cloud Memorystore
            # for Redis API and defines the following resource model for managing Redis
            # clusters:
            # * The service works with a collection of cloud projects, named: `/projects/*`
            # * Each project has a collection of available locations, named: `/locations/*`
            # * Each location has a collection of Redis clusters, named: `/clusters/*`
            # * As such, Redis clusters are resources of the form:
            #   `/projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/clusters/{instance_id}`
            #
            # Note that location_id must be a GCP `region`; for example:
            # * `projects/redpepper-1290/locations/us-central1/clusters/my-redis`
            #
            # We use API version selector for Flex APIs
            # * The versioning strategy is release-based versioning
            # * Our backend CLH only deals with the superset version (called v1main)
            # * Existing backend for Redis Gen1 and MRR is not touched.
            # * More details in go/redis-flex-api-versioning
