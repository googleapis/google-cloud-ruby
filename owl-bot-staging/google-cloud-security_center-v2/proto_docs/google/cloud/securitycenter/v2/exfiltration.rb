        # Exfiltration represents a data exfiltration attempt from one or more sources
        # to one or more targets. The `sources` attribute lists the sources of the
        # exfiltrated data. The `targets` attribute lists the destinations the data was
        # copied to.
        # @!attribute [rw] sources
        #   @return [::Array<::Google::Cloud::SecurityCenter::V2::ExfilResource>]
        #     If there are multiple sources, then the data is considered "joined" between
        #     them. For instance, BigQuery can join multiple tables, and each
        #     table would be considered a source.
        # @!attribute [rw] targets
        #   @return [::Array<::Google::Cloud::SecurityCenter::V2::ExfilResource>]
        #     If there are multiple targets, each target would get a complete copy of the
        #     "joined" source data.
