# Snippet for the list_endpoints call in the IDS service
#
# This is an auto-generated example demonstrating basic usage of
# Google::Cloud::IDS::V1::IDS::Client#list_endpoints. It may require
# modification in order to execute successfully.
#
def list_endpoints
  # Create a client object. The client can be reused for multiple calls.
  client = Google::Cloud::IDS::V1::IDS::Client.new

  # Create a request. To set request fields, pass in keyword arguments.
  request = Google::Cloud::IDS::V1::ListEndpointsRequest.new

  # Call the list_endpoints method.
  result = client.list_endpoints request

  # The returned object is of type Gapic::PagedEnumerable. You can iterate
  # over elements, and API calls will be issued to fetch pages as needed.
  result.each do |item|
    # Each element is of type ::Google::Cloud::IDS::V1::Endpoint.
