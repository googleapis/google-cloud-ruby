        #     [force] and [partition_spec] fields will apply to each of them.
        #
        #     Field [table] will be concatenated with "_" and the asset type names (see
        #     https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/supported-asset-types for
        #     supported asset types) to construct per-asset-type table names, in which
        #     all non-alphanumeric characters like "." and "/" will be substituted by
        #     "_". Example: if field [table] is "mytable" and snapshot results
        #     contain "storage.googleapis.com/Bucket" assets, the corresponding table
        #     name will be "mytable_storage_googleapis_com_Bucket". If any of these
        #     tables does not exist, a new table with the concatenated name will be
        #     created.
        #
        #     When [content_type] in the ExportAssetsRequest is `RESOURCE`, the schema of
        #     each table will include RECORD-type columns mapped to the nested fields in
        #     the Asset.resource.data field of that asset type (up to the 15 nested level
        #     BigQuery supports
        #     (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/nested-repeated#limitations)). The
        #     fields in >15 nested levels will be stored in JSON format string as a child
        #     column of its parent RECORD column.
        #
        #     If error occurs when exporting to any table, the whole export call will
        #     return an error but the export results that already succeed will persist.
        #     Example: if exporting to table_type_A succeeds when exporting to
        #     table_type_B fails during one export call, the results in table_type_A will
        #     persist and there will not be partial results persisting in a table.
