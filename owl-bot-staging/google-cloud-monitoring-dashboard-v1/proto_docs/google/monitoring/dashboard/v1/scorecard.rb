          #     The thresholds used to determine the state of the scorecard given the
          #     time series' current value. For an actual value x, the scorecard is in a
          #     danger state if x is less than or equal to a danger threshold that triggers
          #     below, or greater than or equal to a danger threshold that triggers above.
          #     Similarly, if x is above/below a warning threshold that triggers
          #     above/below, then the scorecard is in a warning state - unless x also puts
          #     it in a danger state. (Danger trumps warning.)
          #
          #     As an example, consider a scorecard with the following four thresholds:
          #     {
          #       value: 90,
          #       category: 'DANGER',
          #       trigger: 'ABOVE',
          #     },
          #     {
          #       value: 70,
          #       category: 'WARNING',
          #       trigger: 'ABOVE',
          #     },
          #     {
          #       value: 10,
          #       category: 'DANGER',
          #       trigger: 'BELOW',
          #     },
          #     {
          #       value: 20,
          #       category: 'WARNING',
          #       trigger: 'BELOW',
          #     }
          #
          #     Then: values less than or equal to 10 would put the scorecard in a DANGER
          #     state, values greater than 10 but less than or equal to 20 a WARNING state,
          #     values strictly between 20 and 70 an OK state, values greater than or equal
          #     to 70 but less than 90 a WARNING state, and values greater than or equal to
          #     90 a DANGER state.
