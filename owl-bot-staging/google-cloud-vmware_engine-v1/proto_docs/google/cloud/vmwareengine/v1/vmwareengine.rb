        # @!attribute [rw] parent
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Required. The resource name of the private cloud to be queried for
        #     clusters. Resource names are schemeless URIs that follow the conventions in
        #     https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names.
        #     For example:
        #     `projects/my-project/locations/us-central1-a`
        # @!attribute [rw] page_size
        #   @return [::Integer]
        #     The maximum number of private clouds to return in one page.
        #     The service may return fewer than this value.
        #     The maximum value is coerced to 1000.
        #     The default value of this field is 500.
        # @!attribute [rw] page_token
        #   @return [::String]
        #     A page token, received from a previous `ListPrivateClouds` call.
        #     Provide this to retrieve the subsequent page.
        #
        #     When paginating, all other parameters provided to `ListPrivateClouds` must
        #     match the call that provided the page token.
        # @!attribute [rw] filter
        #   @return [::String]
        #     A filter expression that matches resources returned in the response.
        #     The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the
        #     value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a
        #     number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be `=`, `!=`, `>`, or
        #     `<`.
        #
        #     For example, if you are filtering a list of private clouds, you can exclude
        #     the ones named `example-pc` by specifying `name != "example-pc"`.
        #
        #     You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
        #     `networkConfig.managementCidr = "192.168.0.0/24"` to include private clouds
        #     only if they have a matching address in their network configuration.
        #
        #     To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
        #     parentheses. For example:
        #     ```
        #     (name = "example-pc")
        #     (createTime > "2021-04-12T08:15:10.40Z")
        #     ```
        #
        #     By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
        #     include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example:
        #     ```
        #     (name = "private-cloud-1") AND
        #     (createTime > "2021-04-12T08:15:10.40Z") OR
        #     (name = "private-cloud-2")
        #     ```
        # @!attribute [rw] order_by
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, returned results are
        #     ordered by `name` in ascending order. You can also sort results in
        #     descending order based on the `name` value using `orderBy="name desc"`.
        #     Currently, only ordering by `name` is supported.

        #
        #     When paginating, all other parameters provided to

        #     token.
        # @!attribute [rw] filter
        #   @return [::String]
        #     A filter expression that matches resources returned in the response.

        #     operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
        #     must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator
        #     must be `=`, `!=`, `>`, or `<`.
        #
        #     For example, if you are filtering a list of network policies, you can
        #     exclude the ones named `example-policy` by specifying
        #     `name != "example-policy"`.
        #
        #     To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
        #     parentheses. For example:
        #     ```
        #     (name = "example-policy")
        #     (createTime > "2021-04-12T08:15:10.40Z")
        #     ```
        #
        #     By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
        #     can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
        #     For example:
        #     ```
        #     (name = "example-policy-1") AND
        #     (createTime > "2021-04-12T08:15:10.40Z") OR

        #     ```

        #     Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, returned results
        #     are ordered by `name` in ascending order.
        #     You can also sort results in descending order based on the `name` value
        #     using `orderBy="name desc"`.
        #     Currently, only ordering by `name` is supported.
