VMware Engine provides you with VMware operational continuity so you can benefit from a cloud consumption model and lower your total cost of ownership. VMware Engine also offers on-demand provisioning, pay-as-you-grow, and capacity optimization. Note that google-cloud-vmware_engine-v1 is a version-specific client library. For most uses, we recommend installing the main client library google-cloud-vmware_engine instead. See the readme for more details.",
