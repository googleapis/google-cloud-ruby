        ##
        # API for interacting with Google Cloud Shell. Each user of Cloud Shell has at
        # least one environment, which has the ID "default". Environment consists of a
        # Docker image defining what is installed on the environment and a home
        # directory containing the user's data that will remain across sessions.
        # Clients use this API to start and fetch information about their environment,
        # which can then be used to connect to that environment via a separate SSH
        # client.
        #
        # @example Load this service and instantiate a gRPC client

        #     require "google/cloud/shell/v1/cloud_shell_service"
