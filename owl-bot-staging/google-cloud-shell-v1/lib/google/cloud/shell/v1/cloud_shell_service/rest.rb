        ##
        # API for interacting with Google Cloud Shell. Each user of Cloud Shell has at
        # least one environment, which has the ID "default". Environment consists of a
        # Docker image defining what is installed on the environment and a home
        # directory containing the user's data that will remain across sessions.
        # Clients use this API to start and fetch information about their environment,
        # which can then be used to connect to that environment via a separate SSH
        # client.
        #
        # To load this service and instantiate a REST client:
        #
        #     require "google/cloud/shell/v1/cloud_shell_service/rest"
        #     client = ::Google::Cloud::Shell::V1::CloudShellService::Rest::Client.new
