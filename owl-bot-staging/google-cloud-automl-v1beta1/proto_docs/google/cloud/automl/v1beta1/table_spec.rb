        # A specification of a relational table.
        # The table's schema is represented via its child column specs. It is
        # pre-populated as part of ImportData by schema inference algorithm, the
        # version of which is a required parameter of ImportData InputConfig.
        # Note: While working with a table, at times the schema may be
        # inconsistent with the data in the table (e.g. string in a FLOAT64 column).
        # The consistency validation is done upon creation of a model.
        # Used by:
        #   *   Tables
