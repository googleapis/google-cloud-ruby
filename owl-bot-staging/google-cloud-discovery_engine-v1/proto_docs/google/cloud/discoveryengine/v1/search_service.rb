          #     is not excluded from the filter unless it is listed in this field.
          #
          #     Listing a facet key in this field allows its values to appear as facet
          #     results, even when they are filtered out of search results. Using this
          #     field does not affect what search results are returned.
          #
          #     For example, suppose there are 100 documents with the color facet "Red"
          #     and 200 documents with the color facet "Blue". A query containing the
          #     filter "color:ANY("Red")" and having "color" as
          #     {::Google::Cloud::DiscoveryEngine::V1::SearchRequest::FacetSpec::FacetKey#key FacetKey.key}
          #     would by default return only "Red" documents in the search results, and

          #     are also blue documents available, "Blue" would not be shown as an
          #     available facet value.
          #
          #     If "color" is listed in "excludedFilterKeys", then the query returns the
          #     facet values "Red" with count 100 and "Blue" with count 200, because the
          #     "color" key is now excluded from the filter. Because this field doesn't
          #     affect search results, the search results are still correctly filtered to
          #     return only "Red" documents.
          #
          #     A maximum of 100 values are allowed. Otherwise, an  `INVALID_ARGUMENT`

          #     this facet among all facets in the response is determined automatically.
          #     If dynamic facets are enabled, it is ordered together.
          #     If set to false, the position of this facet in the
          #     response is the same as in the request, and it is ranked before
          #     the facets with dynamic position enable and all dynamic facets.
          #
          #     For example, you may always want to have rating facet returned in
          #     the response, but it's not necessarily to always display the rating facet
          #     at the top. In that case, you can set enable_dynamic_position to true so
          #     that the position of rating facet in response is determined
          #     automatically.
          #
          #     Another example, assuming you have the following facets in the request:
          #
          #     * "rating", enable_dynamic_position = true
          #
          #     * "price", enable_dynamic_position = false
          #
          #     * "brands", enable_dynamic_position = false
          #
          #     And also you have a dynamic facets enabled, which generates a facet
          #     `gender`. Then the final order of the facets in the response can be
          #     ("price", "brands", "rating", "gender") or ("price", "brands", "gender",
          #     "rating") depends on how API orders "gender" and "rating" facets.
          #     However, notice that "price" and "brands" are always
          #     ranked at first and second position because their enable_dynamic_position
          #     is false.
