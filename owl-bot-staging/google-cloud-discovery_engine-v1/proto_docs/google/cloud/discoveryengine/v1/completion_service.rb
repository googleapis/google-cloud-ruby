        # @!attribute [rw] data_store
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Required. The parent data store resource name for which the completion is
        #     performed, such as
        #     `projects/*/locations/global/collections/default_collection/dataStores/default_data_store`.

        #   @return [::String]

        # @!attribute [rw] query_model
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Selects data model of query suggestions for serving. Currently supported
        #     values:
        #
        #     * `document` - Using suggestions generated from user-imported documents.
        #     * `search-history` - Using suggestions generated from the past history of
        #     {::Google::Cloud::DiscoveryEngine::V1::SearchService::Client#search SearchService.Search}
        #     API calls. Do not use it when there is no traffic for Search API.
        #     * `user-event` - Using suggestions generated from user-imported search
        #     events.
        #     * `document-completable` - Using suggestions taken directly from
        #     user-imported document fields marked as completable.
        #
        #     Default values:
        #
        #     * `document` is the default model for regular dataStores.
        #     * `search-history` is the default model for

        #     A unique identifier for tracking visitors. For example, this could be
        #     implemented with an HTTP cookie, which should be able to uniquely identify
        #     a visitor on a single device. This unique identifier should not change if
        #     the visitor logs in or out of the website.

        #     This field should NOT have a fixed value such as `unknown_visitor`.
