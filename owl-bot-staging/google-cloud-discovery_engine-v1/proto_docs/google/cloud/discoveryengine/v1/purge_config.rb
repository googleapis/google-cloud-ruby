        # Request message for PurgeUserEvents method.
        # @!attribute [rw] parent
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Required. The resource name of the catalog under which the events are
        #     created. The format is
        #     `projects/{project}/locations/global/collections/{collection}/dataStores/{dataStore}`.
        # @!attribute [rw] filter
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Required. The filter string to specify the events to be deleted with a
        #     length limit of 5,000 characters. The eligible fields for filtering are:
        #
        #     * `eventType`: Double quoted
        #     {::Google::Cloud::DiscoveryEngine::V1::UserEvent#event_type UserEvent.event_type}
        #     string.
        #     * `eventTime`: in ISO 8601 "zulu" format.
        #     * `userPseudoId`: Double quoted string. Specifying this will delete all
        #       events associated with a visitor.
        #     * `userId`: Double quoted string. Specifying this will delete all events
        #       associated with a user.
        #
        #     Examples:
        #
        #     * Deleting all events in a time range:
        #       `eventTime > "2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z"
        #       eventTime < "2012-04-23T18:30:43.511Z"`
        #     * Deleting specific eventType:
        #       `eventType = "search"`
        #     * Deleting all events for a specific visitor:
        #       `userPseudoId = "visitor1024"`
        #     * Deleting all events inside a DataStore:
        #       `*`
        #
        #     The filtering fields are assumed to have an implicit AND.
