        # CreateJob Request.

        #   @return [::String]
        #     Required. The parent resource name where the Job will be created.

        # @!attribute [rw] job_id
        #   @return [::String]
        #     ID used to uniquely identify the Job within its parent scope.
        #     This field should contain at most 63 characters and must start with
        #     lowercase characters.
        #     Only lowercase characters, numbers and '-' are accepted.
        #     The '-' character cannot be the first or the last one.
        #     A system generated ID will be used if the field is not set.
        #
        #     The job.name field in the request will be ignored and the created resource
        #     name of the Job will be "\\{parent}/jobs/\\{job_id}".

        # @!attribute [rw] request_id
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique
        #     request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to
        #     ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will
        #     guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request.
        #
        #     For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
        #     the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request
        #     ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID
        #     was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents
        #     clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.
        #
