        #       the [`gcsfuse` tool](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gcsfuse-cli)
        #       are supported.
        #     * For an existing persistent disk, all mount options provided by the
        #       [`mount` command](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/mount.8.html)
        #       except writing are supported. This is due to restrictions of
        #       [multi-writer
        #       mode](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/sharing-disks-between-vms).
        #     * For any other disk or a Network File System (NFS), all the
        #       mount options provided by the `mount` command are supported.
