# Snippet for the list_jobs call in the BatchService service

# This is an auto-generated example demonstrating basic usage of
# Google::Cloud::Batch::V1::BatchService::Client#list_jobs. It may require
# modification in order to execute successfully.

def list_jobs
  # Create a client object. The client can be reused for multiple calls.
  client = Google::Cloud::Batch::V1::BatchService::Client.new

  # Create a request. To set request fields, pass in keyword arguments.
  request = Google::Cloud::Batch::V1::ListJobsRequest.new

  # Call the list_jobs method.
  result = client.list_jobs request

  # The returned object is of type Gapic::PagedEnumerable. You can iterate
