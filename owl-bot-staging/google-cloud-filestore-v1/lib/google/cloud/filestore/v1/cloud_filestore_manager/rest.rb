        #
        # The `file.googleapis.com` service implements the Cloud Filestore API and
        # defines the following resource model for managing instances:
        # * The service works with a collection of cloud projects, named: `/projects/*`
        # * Each project has a collection of available locations, named: `/locations/*`
        # * Each location has a collection of instances and backups, named:
        # `/instances/*` and `/backups/*` respectively.
        # * As such, Cloud Filestore instances are resources of the form:
        #   `/projects/{project_number}/locations/{location_id}/instances/{instance_id}`
        #   and backups are resources of the form:
        #   `/projects/{project_number}/locations/{location_id}/backup/{backup_id}`
        #
        # Note that location_id must be a GCP `zone` for instances and but to a GCP
        # `region` for backups; for example:
        # * `projects/12345/locations/us-central1-c/instances/my-filestore`
        # * `projects/12345/locations/us-central1/backups/my-backup`
        #
        # To load this service and instantiate a REST client:
        #
        #     require "google/cloud/filestore/v1/cloud_filestore_manager/rest"
        #     client = ::Google::Cloud::Filestore::V1::CloudFilestoreManager::Rest::Client.new
        #
        module CloudFilestoreManager
          # Client for the REST transport
