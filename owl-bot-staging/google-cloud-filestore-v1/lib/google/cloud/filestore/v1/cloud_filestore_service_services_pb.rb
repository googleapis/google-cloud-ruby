          # The `file.googleapis.com` service implements the Cloud Filestore API and
          # defines the following resource model for managing instances:
          # * The service works with a collection of cloud projects, named: `/projects/*`
          # * Each project has a collection of available locations, named: `/locations/*`
          # * Each location has a collection of instances and backups, named:
          # `/instances/*` and `/backups/*` respectively.
          # * As such, Cloud Filestore instances are resources of the form:
          #   `/projects/{project_number}/locations/{location_id}/instances/{instance_id}`
          #   and backups are resources of the form:
          #   `/projects/{project_number}/locations/{location_id}/backup/{backup_id}`
          #
          # Note that location_id must be a GCP `zone` for instances and but to a GCP
          # `region` for backups; for example:
          # * `projects/12345/locations/us-central1-c/instances/my-filestore`
          # * `projects/12345/locations/us-central1/backups/my-backup`
