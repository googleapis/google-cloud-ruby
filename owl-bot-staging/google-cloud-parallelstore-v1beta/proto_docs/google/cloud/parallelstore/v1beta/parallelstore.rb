        #   @return [::String]
        #     Optional. The description of the instance. 2048 characters or less.
        # @!attribute [r] state
        #   @return [::Google::Cloud::Parallelstore::V1beta::Instance::State]
        #     Output only. The instance state.
        # @!attribute [r] create_time
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Timestamp]
        #     Output only. The time when the instance was created.
        # @!attribute [r] update_time
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Timestamp]
        #     Output only. The time when the instance was updated.
        # @!attribute [rw] labels
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Map{::String => ::String}]
        #     Optional. Cloud Labels are a flexible and lightweight mechanism for
        #     organizing cloud resources into groups that reflect a customer's
        #     organizational needs and deployment strategies. Cloud Labels can be used to
        #     filter collections of resources. They can be used to control how resource
        #     metrics are aggregated. And they can be used as arguments to policy
        #     management rules (e.g. route, firewall, load balancing, etc.).
        #
        #      * Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long and must conform to
        #        the following regular expression: `[a-z][a-z0-9_-]{0,62}`.
        #      * Label values must be between 0 and 63 characters long and must conform
        #        to the regular expression `[a-z0-9_-]{0,63}`.
        #      * No more than 64 labels can be associated with a given resource.
        #
        #     See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for more information on and examples of labels.
        #
        #     If you plan to use labels in your own code, please note that additional
        #     characters may be allowed in the future. Therefore, you are advised to use
        #     an internal label representation, such as JSON, which doesn't rely upon
        #     specific characters being disallowed.  For example, representing labels
        #     as the string:  name + "_" + value  would prove problematic if we were to
        #     allow "_" in a future release.
