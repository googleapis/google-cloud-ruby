          # The `redis.googleapis.com` service implements the Google Cloud Memorystore
          # for Redis API and defines the following resource model for managing Redis
          # instances:
          # * The service works with a collection of cloud projects, named: `/projects/*`
          # * Each project has a collection of available locations, named: `/locations/*`
          # * Each location has a collection of Redis instances, named: `/instances/*`
          # * As such, Redis instances are resources of the form:
          #   `/projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/instances/{instance_id}`
          #
          # Note that location_id must be referring to a GCP `region`; for example:
          # * `projects/redpepper-1290/locations/us-central1/instances/my-redis`
