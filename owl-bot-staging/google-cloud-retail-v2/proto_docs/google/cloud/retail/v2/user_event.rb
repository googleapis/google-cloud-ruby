        # @!attribute [rw] event_type
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Required. User event type. Allowed values are:
        #
        #     * `add-to-cart`: Products being added to cart.
        #     * `category-page-view`: Special pages such as sale or promotion pages
        #       viewed.
        #     * `detail-page-view`: Products detail page viewed.
        #     * `home-page-view`: Homepage viewed.
        #     * `promotion-offered`: Promotion is offered to a user.
        #     * `promotion-not-offered`: Promotion is not offered to a user.
        #     * `purchase-complete`: User finishing a purchase.
        #     * `search`: Product search.
        #     * `shopping-cart-page-view`: User viewing a shopping cart.
        # @!attribute [rw] visitor_id
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Required. A unique identifier for tracking visitors.
        #
        #     For example, this could be implemented with an HTTP cookie, which should be
        #     able to uniquely identify a visitor on a single device. This unique
        #     identifier should not change if the visitor log in/out of the website.
        #
        #     Don't set the field to the same fixed ID for different users. This mixes
        #     the event history of those users together, which results in degraded model
        #     quality.
        #
        #     The field must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 128
        #     characters. Otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned.
        #
        #     The field should not contain PII or user-data. We recommend to use Google
        #     Analytics [Client
        #     ID](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/field-reference#clientId)
        #     for this field.
        # @!attribute [rw] session_id
        #   @return [::String]
        #     A unique identifier for tracking a visitor session with a length limit of
        #     128 bytes. A session is an aggregation of an end user behavior in a time
        #     span.
        #
        #     A general guideline to populate the sesion_id:
        #     1. If user has no activity for 30 min, a new session_id should be assigned.
        #     2. The session_id should be unique across users, suggest use uuid or add
        #     visitor_id as prefix.
        # @!attribute [rw] event_time
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Timestamp]
        #     Only required for
        #     {::Google::Cloud::Retail::V2::UserEventService::Client#import_user_events UserEventService.ImportUserEvents}
        #     method. Timestamp of when the user event happened.
        # @!attribute [rw] experiment_ids
        #   @return [::Array<::String>]
        #     A list of identifiers for the independent experiment groups this user event
        #     belongs to. This is used to distinguish between user events associated with
        #     different experiment setups (e.g. using Retail API, using different
        #     recommendation models).
        # @!attribute [rw] attribution_token
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Highly recommended for user events that are the result of
        #     {::Google::Cloud::Retail::V2::PredictionService::Client#predict PredictionService.Predict}.
        #     This field enables accurate attribution of recommendation model
        #     performance.
        #
        #     The value must be a valid
        #     {::Google::Cloud::Retail::V2::PredictResponse#attribution_token PredictResponse.attribution_token}
        #     for user events that are the result of
        #     {::Google::Cloud::Retail::V2::PredictionService::Client#predict PredictionService.Predict}.
        #     The value must be a valid
        #     {::Google::Cloud::Retail::V2::SearchResponse#attribution_token SearchResponse.attribution_token}
        #     for user events that are the result of
        #     {::Google::Cloud::Retail::V2::SearchService::Client#search SearchService.Search}.
        #
        #     This token enables us to accurately attribute page view or purchase back to
        #     the event and the particular predict response containing this
        #     clicked/purchased product. If user clicks on product K in the
        #     recommendation results, pass
        #     {::Google::Cloud::Retail::V2::PredictResponse#attribution_token PredictResponse.attribution_token}
        #     as a URL parameter to product K's page. When recording events on product
        #     K's page, log the
        #     {::Google::Cloud::Retail::V2::PredictResponse#attribution_token PredictResponse.attribution_token}
        #     to this field.
        # @!attribute [rw] product_details
        #   @return [::Array<::Google::Cloud::Retail::V2::ProductDetail>]
        #     The main product details related to the event.
        #
        #     This field is optional except for the following event types:
        #
        #     * `add-to-cart`
        #     * `detail-page-view`
        #     * `purchase-complete`
        #
        #     In a `search` event, this field represents the products returned to the end
        #     user on the current page (the end user may have not finished browsing the
        #     whole page yet). When a new page is returned to the end user, after
        #     pagination/filtering/ordering even for the same query, a new `search` event
        #     with different
        #     {::Google::Cloud::Retail::V2::UserEvent#product_details product_details} is
        #     desired. The end user may have not finished browsing the whole page yet.
        # @!attribute [rw] completion_detail
        #   @return [::Google::Cloud::Retail::V2::CompletionDetail]
        #     The main auto-completion details related to the event.
        #
        #     This field should be set for `search` event when autocomplete function is
        #     enabled and the user clicks a suggestion for search.
        # @!attribute [rw] attributes
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Map{::String => ::Google::Cloud::Retail::V2::CustomAttribute}]
        #     Extra user event features to include in the recommendation model.
        #
        #     If you provide custom attributes for ingested user events, also include
        #     them in the user events that you associate with prediction requests. Custom
        #     attribute formatting must be consistent between imported events and events
        #     provided with prediction requests. This lets the Retail API use
        #     those custom attributes when training models and serving predictions, which
        #     helps improve recommendation quality.
        #
        #     This field needs to pass all below criteria, otherwise an INVALID_ARGUMENT
        #     error is returned:
        #
        #     * The key must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 5,000
        #       characters.
        #     * For text attributes, at most 400 values are allowed. Empty values are not
        #       allowed. Each value must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of
        #       256 characters.
        #     * For number attributes, at most 400 values are allowed.
        #
        #     For product recommendations, an example of extra user information is
        #     traffic_channel, which is how a user arrives at the site. Users can arrive
        #     at the site by coming to the site directly, coming through Google
        #     search, or in other ways.
        # @!attribute [rw] cart_id
        #   @return [::String]
        #     The ID or name of the associated shopping cart. This ID is used
        #     to associate multiple items added or present in the cart before purchase.
        #
        #     This can only be set for `add-to-cart`, `purchase-complete`, or
