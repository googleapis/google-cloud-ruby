        # @!attribute [rw] parent
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Required. The resource name of the branch under which the products are

        #     Required. The filter string to specify the products to be deleted with a

        #
        #     Empty string filter is not allowed. "*" implies delete all items in a
        #     branch.
        #
        #     The eligible fields for filtering are:
        #
        #     * `availability`: Double quoted
        #     {::Google::Cloud::Retail::V2::Product#availability Product.availability} string.
        #     * `create_time` : in ISO 8601 "zulu" format.
        #
        #     Supported syntax:
        #
        #     * Comparators (">", "<", ">=", "<=", "=").
        #       Examples:
        #       * create_time <= "2015-02-13T17:05:46Z"
        #       * availability = "IN_STOCK"
        #
        #     * Conjunctions ("AND")
        #       Examples:
        #       * create_time <= "2015-02-13T17:05:46Z" AND availability = "PREORDER"
        #
        #     * Disjunctions ("OR")
        #       Examples:
        #       * create_time <= "2015-02-13T17:05:46Z" OR availability = "IN_STOCK"
        #
        #     * Can support nested queries.
        #       Examples:
        #       * (create_time <= "2015-02-13T17:05:46Z" AND availability = "PREORDER")
        #       OR (create_time >= "2015-02-14T13:03:32Z" AND availability = "IN_STOCK")
        #
        #     * Filter Limits:
        #       * Filter should not contain more than 6 conditions.
        #       * Max nesting depth should not exceed 2 levels.
        #
        #     Examples queries:
        #     * Delete back order products created before a timestamp.
        #       create_time <= "2015-02-13T17:05:46Z" OR availability = "BACKORDER"
