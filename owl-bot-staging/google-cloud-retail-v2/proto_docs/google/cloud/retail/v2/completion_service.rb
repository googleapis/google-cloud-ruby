        # Autocomplete parameters.
        # @!attribute [rw] catalog
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Required. Catalog for which the completion is performed.
        #
        #     Full resource name of catalog, such as
        #     `projects/*/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog`.
        # @!attribute [rw] query
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Required. The query used to generate suggestions.
        #
        #     The maximum number of allowed characters is 255.
        # @!attribute [rw] visitor_id
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Required field. A unique identifier for tracking visitors. For example,
        #     this could be implemented with an HTTP cookie, which should be able to
        #     uniquely identify a visitor on a single device. This unique identifier
        #     should not change if the visitor logs in or out of the website.
        #
        #     The field must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 128
        #     characters. Otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned.
        # @!attribute [rw] language_codes
        #   @return [::Array<::String>]
        #     Note that this field applies for `user-data` dataset only. For requests
        #     with `cloud-retail` dataset, setting this field has no effect.
        #
        #     The language filters applied to the output suggestions. If set, it should
        #     contain the language of the query. If not set, suggestions are returned
        #     without considering language restrictions. This is the BCP-47 language
        #     code, such as "en-US" or "sr-Latn". For more information, see [Tags for
        #     Identifying Languages](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47). The maximum
        #     number of language codes is 3.
        # @!attribute [rw] device_type
        #   @return [::String]
        #     The device type context for completion suggestions. We recommend that you
        #     leave this field empty.
        #
        #     It can apply different suggestions on different device types, e.g.
        #     `DESKTOP`, `MOBILE`. If it is empty, the suggestions are across all device
        #     types.
        #
        #     Supported formats:
        #
        #     * `UNKNOWN_DEVICE_TYPE`
        #
        #     * `DESKTOP`
        #
        #     * `MOBILE`
        #
        #     * A customized string starts with `OTHER_`, e.g. `OTHER_IPHONE`.
        # @!attribute [rw] dataset
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Determines which dataset to use for fetching completion. "user-data" will
        #     use the imported dataset through
        #     {::Google::Cloud::Retail::V2::CompletionService::Client#import_completion_data CompletionService.ImportCompletionData}.
        #     "cloud-retail" will use the dataset generated by cloud retail based on user
        #     events. If leave empty, it will use the "user-data".
        #
        #     Current supported values:
        #
        #     * user-data
        #
        #     * cloud-retail:
        #       This option requires enabling auto-learning function first. See
        #       [guidelines](https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs/completion-overview#generated-completion-dataset).
        # @!attribute [rw] max_suggestions
        #   @return [::Integer]

        #     to the configured value
        #     {::Google::Cloud::Retail::V2::CompletionConfig#max_suggestions CompletionConfig.max_suggestions}.
        #
        #     The maximum allowed max suggestions is 20. If it is set higher, it will be

        #   @return [::String]
        #     The entity for customers that may run multiple different entities, domains,
