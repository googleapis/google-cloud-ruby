        # Service for performing CRUD operations on models.
        # Recommendation models contain all the metadata necessary to generate a set of
        # models for the `Predict()` API. A model is queried
        # indirectly via a ServingConfig, which associates a model with a
        # given Placement (e.g. Frequently Bought Together on Home Page).
        #
        # This service allows you to do the following:
        #
        # * Initiate training of a model.
        # * Pause training of an existing model.
        # * List all the available models along with their metadata.
        # * Control their tuning schedule.
        #
