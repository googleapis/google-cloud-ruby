          #
          # Programs provide a mechanism for adding functionality to merchant accounts. A
          # typical example of this is the [Free product
          # listings](https://support.google.com/merchants/topic/9240261?ref_topic=7257954,7259405,&sjid=796648681813264022-EU)
          # program, which enables products from a merchant's store to be shown across
          # Google for free.
          #
          # This service exposes methods to retrieve a merchant's
          # participation in all available programs, in addition to methods for
          # explicitly enabling or disabling participation in each program.
