          # * If the merchant has accepted a terms of service:
          # [accepted](TermsOfServiceAggrementState.accepted) will be populated,

          # * If the merchant must sign a terms of service:
          # [required](TermsOfServiceAggrementState.required) will be populated,
          # otherwise it will be empty.

          # Note that both [required](TermsOfServiceAggrementState.required) and
