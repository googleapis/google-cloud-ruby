      # for a gRPC client for version V1 of the API.
      # However, you can specify a different API version by passing it in the
      # `version` parameter. If the GSuiteAddOns service is
      # supported by that API version, and the corresponding gem is available, the
      # appropriate versioned client will be returned.
      # You can also specify a different transport by passing `:rest` or `:grpc` in
      # the `transport` parameter.

      # ## About GSuiteAddOns
      #
      # A service for managing Google Workspace Add-ons deployments.
      #
      # A Google Workspace Add-on is a third-party embedded component that can be
      # installed in Google Workspace Applications like Gmail, Calendar, Drive, and
      # the Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides editors. Google Workspace Add-ons can
      # display UI cards, receive contextual information from the host application,
      # and perform actions in the host application (See:
      # https://developers.google.com/gsuite/add-ons/overview for more information).
      #
      # A Google Workspace Add-on deployment resource specifies metadata about the
      # add-on, including a specification of the entry points in the host application
      # that trigger add-on executions (see:
      # https://developers.google.com/gsuite/add-ons/concepts/gsuite-manifests).
      # Add-on deployments defined via the Google Workspace Add-ons API define their
      # entrypoints using HTTPS URLs (See:
      # https://developers.google.com/gsuite/add-ons/guides/alternate-runtimes),
      #
      # A Google Workspace Add-on deployment can be installed in developer mode,
      # which allows an add-on developer to test the experience an end-user would see
      # when installing and running the add-on in their G Suite applications.  When
      # running in developer mode, more detailed error messages are exposed in the
      # add-on UI to aid in debugging.
      #
      # A Google Workspace Add-on deployment can be published to Google Workspace
      # Marketplace, which allows other Google Workspace users to discover and
      # install the add-on.  See:
      # https://developers.google.com/gsuite/add-ons/how-tos/publish-add-on-overview
      # for details.
      #
      # @param version [::String, ::Symbol] The API version to connect to. Optional.
      #   Defaults to `:v1`.
      # @param transport [:grpc, :rest] The transport to use. Defaults to `:grpc`.
      # @return [::Object] A client object for the specified version.
