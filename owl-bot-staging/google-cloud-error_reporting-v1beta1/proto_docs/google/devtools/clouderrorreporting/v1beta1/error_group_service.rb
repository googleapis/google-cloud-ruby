        # A request to return an individual group.
        # @!attribute [rw] group_name
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Required. The group resource name. Written as either
        #     `projects/{projectID}/groups/{group_id}` or
        #     `projects/{projectID}/locations/{location}/groups/{group_id}`. Call
        #     [groupStats.list]
        #     [google.devtools.clouderrorreporting.v1beta1.ErrorStatsService.ListGroupStats]
        #     to return a list of groups belonging to this project.
        #
        #     Examples: `projects/my-project-123/groups/my-group`,
        #     `projects/my-project-123/locations/global/groups/my-group`
        #
        #     In the group resource name, the `group_id` is a unique identifier for a
        #     particular error group. The identifier is derived from key parts of the
        #     error-log content and is treated as Service Data. For information about
        #     how Service Data is handled, see [Google Cloud Privacy
        #     Notice](https://cloud.google.com/terms/cloud-privacy-notice).
        #
        #     For a list of supported locations, see [Supported
        #     Regions](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/region-support). `global` is
        #     the default when unspecified.
