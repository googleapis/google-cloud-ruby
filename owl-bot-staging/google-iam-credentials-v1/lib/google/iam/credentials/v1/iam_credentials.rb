        # A service account is a special type of Google account that belongs to your
        # application or a virtual machine (VM), instead of to an individual end user.
        # Your application assumes the identity of the service account to call Google
        # APIs, so that the users aren't directly involved.
        #
        # Service account credentials are used to temporarily assume the identity
        # of the service account. Supported credential types include OAuth 2.0 access
        # tokens, OpenID Connect ID tokens, self-signed JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), and
        # more.
