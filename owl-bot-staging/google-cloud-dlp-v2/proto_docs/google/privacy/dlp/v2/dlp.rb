        #     characters comprising the surrogate. The following scheme defines the
        #     format: \\{info type name}(\\{surrogate character count}):\\{surrogate}
        #
        #     For example, if the name of custom info type is 'MY_TOKEN_INFO_TYPE' and

        #     will be: 'MY_TOKEN_INFO_TYPE(3):abc'
        #
        #     This annotation identifies the surrogate when inspecting content using the
        #     custom info type 'Surrogate'. This facilitates reversal of the
        #     surrogate when it occurs in free text.
        #
        #     Note: For record transformations where the entire cell in a table is being
        #     transformed, surrogates are not mandatory. Surrogates are used to denote
        #     the location of the token and are necessary for re-identification in free
        #     form text.
        #
        #     In order for inspection to work properly, the name of this info type must
        #     not occur naturally anywhere in your data; otherwise, inspection may either
        #
        #     - reverse a surrogate that does not correspond to an actual identifier
        #     - be unable to parse the surrogate and result in an error

        #     what your data looks like. One way to select a name that has a high chance
        #     of yielding reliable detection is to include one or more unicode characters
        #     that are highly improbable to exist in your data.

        #
        #     Example: `name asc,update_time, create_time desc`
        #
        #     Supported fields are:
        #
        #     - `create_time`: corresponds to the time the JobTrigger was created.

        #     * Restrictions can be combined by `AND` or `OR` logical operators. A
        #     sequence of restrictions implicitly uses `AND`.
        #     * A restriction has the form of `{field} {operator} {value}`.
        #     * Supported fields/values for inspect triggers:
        #         - `status` - HEALTHY|PAUSED|CANCELLED
        #         - `inspected_storage` - DATASTORE|CLOUD_STORAGE|BIGQUERY
        #         - 'last_run_time` - RFC 3339 formatted timestamp, surrounded by
        #         quotation marks. Nanoseconds are ignored.
        #         - 'error_count' - Number of errors that have occurred while running.
        #     * The operator must be `=` or `!=` for status and inspected_storage.
        #
        #     Examples:
        #
        #     * inspected_storage = cloud_storage AND status = HEALTHY
        #     * inspected_storage = cloud_storage OR inspected_storage = bigquery
