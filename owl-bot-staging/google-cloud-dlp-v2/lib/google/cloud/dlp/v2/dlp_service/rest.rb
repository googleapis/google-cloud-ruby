        # The Cloud Data Loss Prevention (DLP) API is a service that allows clients
        # to detect the presence of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and other
        # privacy-sensitive data in user-supplied, unstructured data streams, like text
        # blocks or images.
        # The service also includes methods for sensitive data redaction and
        # scheduling of data scans on Google Cloud Platform based data sets.
        #
        # To learn more about concepts and find how-to guides see
        # https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/.
