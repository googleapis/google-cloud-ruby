    # A security vulnerability that can be found in resources.
    # @!attribute [rw] cvss_score
    #   @return [::Float]
    #     The CVSS score of this vulnerability. CVSS score is on a scale of 0 - 10
    #     where 0 indicates low severity and 10 indicates high severity.
    # @!attribute [rw] severity
    #   @return [::Grafeas::V1::Severity]
    #     The note provider assigned severity of this vulnerability.

    #     Details of all known distros and packages affected by this vulnerability.
    # @!attribute [rw] cvss_v3
    #   @return [::Grafeas::V1::CVSSv3]
    #     The full description of the CVSSv3 for this vulnerability.
    # @!attribute [rw] windows_details

    #     Windows details get their own format because the information format and
    #     model don't match a normal detail. Specifically Windows updates are done as
    #     patches, thus Windows vulnerabilities really are a missing package, rather
    #     than a package being at an incorrect version.

    #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Timestamp]
    #     The time this information was last changed at the source. This is an

    #     security tracker.
