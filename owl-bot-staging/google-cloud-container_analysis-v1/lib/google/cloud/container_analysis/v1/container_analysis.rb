        ##
        # Retrieves analysis results of Cloud components such as Docker container
        # images. The Container Analysis API is an implementation of the
        # [Grafeas](https://grafeas.io) API.
        #
        # Analysis results are stored as a series of occurrences. An `Occurrence`
        # contains information about a specific analysis instance on a resource. An
        # occurrence refers to a `Note`. A note contains details describing the
        # analysis and is generally stored in a separate project, called a `Provider`.
        # Multiple occurrences can refer to the same note.
        #
        # For example, an SSL vulnerability could affect multiple images. In this case,
        # there would be one note for the vulnerability and an occurrence for each
        # image with the vulnerability referring to that note.
