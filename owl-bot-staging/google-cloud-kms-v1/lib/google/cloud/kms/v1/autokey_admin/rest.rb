        # Provides interfaces for managing [Cloud KMS
        # Autokey](https://cloud.google.com/kms/help/autokey) folder-level or
        # project-level configurations. A configuration is inherited by all descendent
        # folders and projects. A configuration at a folder or project overrides any
        # other configurations in its ancestry. Setting a configuration on a folder is
        # a prerequisite for Cloud KMS Autokey, so that users working in a descendant
        # project can request provisioned {::Google::Cloud::Kms::V1::CryptoKey CryptoKeys},
        # ready for Customer Managed Encryption Key (CMEK) use, on-demand when using
        # the dedicated key project mode. This is not required when using the delegated
        # key management mode for same-project keys.
