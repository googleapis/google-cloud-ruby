        # resource model:
        #
        # - The API has a collection of
        # {::Google::Cloud::ServiceDirectory::V1beta1::Namespace Namespace}
        # resources, named `projects/*/locations/*/namespaces/*`.
        #
        # - Each Namespace has a collection of
        # {::Google::Cloud::ServiceDirectory::V1beta1::Service Service} resources, named
        # `projects/*/locations/*/namespaces/*/services/*`.
        #
        # - Each Service has a collection of
        # {::Google::Cloud::ServiceDirectory::V1beta1::Endpoint Endpoint}
        # resources, named
        # `projects/*/locations/*/namespaces/*/services/*/endpoints/*`.
        #
        # @example Load this service and instantiate a gRPC client
        #
        #     require "google/cloud/service_directory/v1beta1/registration_service"
        #     client = ::Google::Cloud::ServiceDirectory::V1beta1::RegistrationService::Client.new
