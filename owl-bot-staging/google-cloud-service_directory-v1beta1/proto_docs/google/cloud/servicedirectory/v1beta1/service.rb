        # An individual service. A service contains a name and optional metadata.
        # A service must exist before
        # {::Google::Cloud::ServiceDirectory::V1beta1::Endpoint endpoints} can be
        # added to it.
        # @!attribute [rw] name
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Immutable. The resource name for the service in the format
        #     `projects/*/locations/*/namespaces/*/services/*`.
        # @!attribute [rw] metadata
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Map{::String => ::String}]
        #     Optional. Metadata for the service. This data can be consumed by service
        #     clients.
        #
        #     Restrictions:
        #
        #     *   The entire metadata dictionary may contain up to 2000 characters,
        #         spread accoss all key-value pairs. Metadata that goes beyond this
        #         limit are rejected
        #     *   Valid metadata keys have two segments: an optional prefix and name,
        #         separated by a slash (/). The name segment is required and must be 63
        #         characters or less, beginning and ending with an alphanumeric character
        #         ([a-z0-9A-Z]) with dashes (-), underscores (_), dots (.), and
        #         alphanumerics between. The prefix is optional. If specified, the prefix
        #         must be a DNS subdomain: a series of DNS labels separated by dots (.),
        #         not longer than 253 characters in total, followed by a slash (/).
        #         Metadata that fails to meet these requirements are rejected
        #
        #     Note: This field is equivalent to the `annotations` field in the v1 API.
        #     They have the same syntax and read/write to the same location in Service
        #     Directory.
        # @!attribute [r] endpoints
        #   @return [::Array<::Google::Cloud::ServiceDirectory::V1beta1::Endpoint>]

        #     Control plane clients should use
        #     {::Google::Cloud::ServiceDirectory::V1beta1::RegistrationService::Client#list_endpoints RegistrationService.ListEndpoints}.
        # @!attribute [r] create_time
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Timestamp]
        #     Output only. The timestamp when the service was created.
        # @!attribute [r] update_time
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Timestamp]
        #     Output only. The timestamp when the service was last updated. Note:
        #     endpoints being created/deleted/updated within the service are not
        #     considered service updates for the purpose of this timestamp.
        # @!attribute [r] uid
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Output only. A globally unique identifier (in UUID4 format) for this
        #     service.
