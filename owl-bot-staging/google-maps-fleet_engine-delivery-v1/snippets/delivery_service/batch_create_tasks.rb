# Snippet for the batch_create_tasks call in the DeliveryService service
#
# This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code
# template only. It will require modifications to work:
# - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
# - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service
# client as shown in https://cloud.google.com/ruby/docs/reference.
#
# This is an auto-generated example demonstrating basic usage of
# Google::Maps::FleetEngine::Delivery::V1::DeliveryService::Client#batch_create_tasks.
#
def batch_create_tasks
  # Create a client object. The client can be reused for multiple calls.
  client = Google::Maps::FleetEngine::Delivery::V1::DeliveryService::Client.new

  # Create a request. To set request fields, pass in keyword arguments.
  request = Google::Maps::FleetEngine::Delivery::V1::BatchCreateTasksRequest.new

  # Call the batch_create_tasks method.
  result = client.batch_create_tasks request

  # The returned object is of type Google::Maps::FleetEngine::Delivery::V1::BatchCreateTasksResponse.
  p result
