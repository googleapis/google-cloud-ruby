# Snippet for the create_delivery_vehicle call in the DeliveryService service
#
# This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code
# template only. It will require modifications to work:
# - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
# - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service
# client as shown in https://cloud.google.com/ruby/docs/reference.
#
# This is an auto-generated example demonstrating basic usage of
# Google::Maps::FleetEngine::Delivery::V1::DeliveryService::Client#create_delivery_vehicle.
#
def create_delivery_vehicle
  # Create a client object. The client can be reused for multiple calls.
  client = Google::Maps::FleetEngine::Delivery::V1::DeliveryService::Client.new

  # Create a request. To set request fields, pass in keyword arguments.
  request = Google::Maps::FleetEngine::Delivery::V1::CreateDeliveryVehicleRequest.new

  # Call the create_delivery_vehicle method.
  result = client.create_delivery_vehicle request

  # The returned object is of type Google::Maps::FleetEngine::Delivery::V1::DeliveryVehicle.
  p result
