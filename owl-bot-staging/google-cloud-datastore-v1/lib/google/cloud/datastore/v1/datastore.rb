        # Each RPC normalizes the partition IDs of the keys in its input entities,
        # and always returns entities with keys with normalized partition IDs.
        # This applies to all keys and entities, including those in values, except keys
        # with both an empty path and an empty or unset partition ID. Normalization of
        # input keys sets the project ID (if not already set) to the project ID from
        # the request.
