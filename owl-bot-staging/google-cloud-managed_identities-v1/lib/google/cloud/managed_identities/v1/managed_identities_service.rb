        # API Overview
        #
        # The `managedidentites.googleapis.com` service implements the Google Cloud
        # Managed Identites API for identity services
        # (e.g. Microsoft Active Directory).
        #
        # The Managed Identities service provides methods to manage
        # (create/read/update/delete) domains, reset managed identities admin password,
        # add/remove domain controllers in GCP regions and add/remove VPC peering.
        #
        # Data Model
        #
        # The Managed Identities service exposes the following resources:
        #
        # * Locations as global, named as follows:
        #   `projects/{project_id}/locations/global`.
        #
        # * Domains, named as follows:
        #   `/projects/{project_id}/locations/global/domain/{domain_name}`.
        #
        # The `{domain_name}` refers to fully qualified domain name in the customer
        # project e.g. mydomain.myorganization.com, with the following restrictions:
        #
        #  * Must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, periods and hyphens.
        #  * Must start with a letter.
        #  * Must contain between 2-64 characters.
        #  * Must end with a number or a letter.
        #  * Must not start with period.
        #  * First segement length (mydomain form example above) shouldn't exceed
        #    15 chars.
        #  * The last segment cannot be fully numeric.
        #  * Must be unique within the customer project.
        #
        # To load this service and instantiate a client:
        #
        #     require "google/cloud/managed_identities/v1/managed_identities_service"
        #     client = ::Google::Cloud::ManagedIdentities::V1::ManagedIdentitiesService::Client.new
        #
        module ManagedIdentitiesService
        end
      end
    end
  end
