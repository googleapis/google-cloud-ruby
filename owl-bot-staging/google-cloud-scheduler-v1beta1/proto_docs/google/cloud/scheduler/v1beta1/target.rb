        #       modified `User-Agent`.
        #     * `X-CloudScheduler`: This header will be set to true.
        #
        #     If the job has an {::Google::Cloud::Scheduler::V1beta1::AppEngineHttpTarget#body body}, Cloud Scheduler sets
        #     the following headers:
        #
        #     * `Content-Type`: By default, the `Content-Type` header is set to
        #       `"application/octet-stream"`. The default can be overridden by explictly
        #       setting `Content-Type` to a particular media type when the job is
        #       created.
        #       For example, `Content-Type` can be set to `"application/json"`.
        #     * `Content-Length`: This is computed by Cloud Scheduler. This value is
        #       output only. It cannot be changed.
        #
        #     The headers below are output only. They cannot be set or overridden:
