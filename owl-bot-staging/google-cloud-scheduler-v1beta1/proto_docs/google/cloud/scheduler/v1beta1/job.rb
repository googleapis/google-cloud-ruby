        #
        #     Describes the schedule on which the job will be executed.
        #
        #     The schedule can be either of the following types:
        #
        #     * [Crontab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#Overview)
        #     * English-like
        #     [schedule](https://cloud.google.com/scheduler/docs/configuring/cron-job-schedules)
        #
        #     As a general rule, execution `n + 1` of a job will not begin
        #     until execution `n` has finished. Cloud Scheduler will never
        #     allow two simultaneously outstanding executions. For example,
        #     this implies that if the `n+1`th execution is scheduled to run at
        #     16:00 but the `n`th execution takes until 16:15, the `n+1`th
        #     execution will not start until `16:15`.
        #     A scheduled start time will be delayed if the previous
        #     execution has not ended when its scheduled time occurs.

        #     {::Google::Cloud::Scheduler::V1beta1::RetryConfig#retry_count retry_count}

        #     field must be a time zone name from the [tz
        #     database](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database).
        #
        #     Note that some time zones include a provision for
        #     daylight savings time. The rules for daylight saving time are
        #     determined by the chosen tz. For UTC use the string "utc". If a
        #     time zone is not specified, the default will be in UTC (also known

        # @!attribute [rw] last_attempt_time

        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Duration]
        #     The deadline for job attempts. If the request handler does not respond by
        #     this deadline then the request is cancelled and the attempt is marked as a
        #     `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED` failure. The failed attempt can be viewed in
        #     execution logs. Cloud Scheduler will retry the job according
        #     to the {::Google::Cloud::Scheduler::V1beta1::RetryConfig RetryConfig}.
        #
        #     The default and the allowed values depend on the type of target:
        #
        #     * For {::Google::Cloud::Scheduler::V1beta1::Job#http_target HTTP targets}, the
        #     default is 3 minutes. The deadline must be in the interval [15 seconds, 30
        #     minutes].

        #     targets][google.cloud.scheduler.v1beta1.Job.app_engine_http_target], 0
        #     indicates that the request has the default deadline. The default deadline
        #     depends on the scaling type of the service: 10 minutes for standard apps
        #     with automatic scaling, 24 hours for standard apps with manual and basic
        #     scaling, and 60 minutes for flex apps. If the request deadline is set, it
        #     must be in the interval [15 seconds, 24 hours 15 seconds].
        #
        #     * For [Pub/Sub targets][google.cloud.scheduler.v1beta1.Job.pubsub_target],
