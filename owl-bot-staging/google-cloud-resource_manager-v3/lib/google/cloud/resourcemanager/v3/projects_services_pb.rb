            #
            # Note: Removing service accounts from policies or changing their roles can
            # render services completely inoperable. It is important to understand how
            # the service account is being used before removing or updating its roles.
            #
            # The following constraints apply when using `setIamPolicy()`:
            #
            # + Project does not support `allUsers` and `allAuthenticatedUsers` as
            # `members` in a `Binding` of a `Policy`.
            #
            # + The owner role can be granted to a `user`, `serviceAccount`, or a group
            # that is part of an organization. For example,
            # group@myownpersonaldomain.com could be added as an owner to a project in
            # the myownpersonaldomain.com organization, but not the examplepetstore.com
            # organization.
            #
            # + Service accounts can be made owners of a project directly
            # without any restrictions. However, to be added as an owner, a user must be
            # invited using the Cloud Platform console and must accept the invitation.
            #
            # + A user cannot be granted the owner role using `setIamPolicy()`. The user
            # must be granted the owner role using the Cloud Platform Console and must
            # explicitly accept the invitation.
            #
            # + Invitations to grant the owner role cannot be sent using
            # `setIamPolicy()`;
            # they must be sent only using the Cloud Platform Console.
            #
            # + Membership changes that leave the project without any owners that have
            # accepted the Terms of Service (ToS) will be rejected.
            #
            # + If the project is not part of an organization, there must be at least
            # one owner who has accepted the Terms of Service (ToS) agreement in the
            # policy. Calling `setIamPolicy()` to remove the last ToS-accepted owner
            # from the policy will fail. This restriction also applies to legacy
            # projects that no longer have owners who have accepted the ToS. Edits to
            # IAM policies will be rejected until the lack of a ToS-accepting owner is
            # rectified.
            #
