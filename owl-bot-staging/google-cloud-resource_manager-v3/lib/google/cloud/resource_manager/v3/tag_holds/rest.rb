        # Allow users to create and manage TagHolds for TagValues. TagHolds represent
        # the use of a Tag Value that is not captured by TagBindings but
        # should still block TagValue deletion (such as a reference in a policy
        # condition). This service provides isolated failure domains by cloud location
        # so that TagHolds can be managed in the same location as their usage.

        #     require "google/cloud/resource_manager/v3/tag_holds/rest"
