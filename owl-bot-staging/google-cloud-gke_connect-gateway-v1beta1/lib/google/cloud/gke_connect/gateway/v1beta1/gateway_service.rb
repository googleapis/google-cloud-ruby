          # Gateway service is a public API which works as a Kubernetes resource model
          # proxy between end users and registered Kubernetes clusters. Each RPC in this
          # service matches with an HTTP verb. End user will initiate kubectl commands
          # against the Gateway service, and Gateway service will forward user requests
          # to clusters.
          #
          # @example Load this service and instantiate a gRPC client
