# This is an auto-generated example demonstrating basic usage of
# Google::Cloud::ApiKeys::V2::ApiKeys::Client#delete_key. It may require
# modification in order to execute successfully.

  # Call the delete_key method.

  # check the status of an operation, cancel it, or wait for results.
  # Here is how to wait for a response.
