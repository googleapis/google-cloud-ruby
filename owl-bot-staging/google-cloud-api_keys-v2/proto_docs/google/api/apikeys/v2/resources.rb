        # @!attribute [r] name
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Output only. The resource name of the key.
        #     The `name` has the form:
        #     `projects/<PROJECT_NUMBER>/locations/global/keys/<KEY_ID>`.
        #     For example:
        #     `projects/123456867718/locations/global/keys/b7ff1f9f-8275-410a-94dd-3855ee9b5dd2`
        #
        #     NOTE: Key is a global resource; hence the only supported value for
        #     location is `global`.

        #   @return [::String]
        #     Output only. Unique id in UUID4 format.

        #   @return [::String]
        #     Human-readable display name of this key that you can modify.
        #     The maximum length is 63 characters.
        # @!attribute [r] key_string
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Output only. An encrypted and signed value held by this key.
        #     This field can be accessed only through the `GetKeyString` method.
        # @!attribute [r] create_time
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Timestamp]
        #     Output only. A timestamp identifying the time this key was originally
        #     created.
        # @!attribute [r] update_time
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Timestamp]
        #     Output only. A timestamp identifying the time this key was last

        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Timestamp]
        #     Output only. A timestamp when this key was deleted. If the resource is not
        #     deleted, this must be empty.
        # @!attribute [rw] annotations
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Map{::String => ::String}]
        #     Annotations is an unstructured key-value map stored with a policy that
        #     may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata.
        #     They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects.

        #   @return [::String]
        #     Output only. A checksum computed by the server based on the current value
        #     of the Key resource. This may be sent on update and delete requests to
        #     ensure the client has an up-to-date value before proceeding. See
