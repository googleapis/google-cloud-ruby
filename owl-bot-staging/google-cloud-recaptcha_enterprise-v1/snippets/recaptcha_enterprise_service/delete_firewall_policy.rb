# Snippet for the delete_firewall_policy call in the RecaptchaEnterpriseService service
#
# This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code
# template only. It will require modifications to work:
# - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
# - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service
# client as shown in https://cloud.google.com/ruby/docs/reference.
#
# This is an auto-generated example demonstrating basic usage of
# Google::Cloud::RecaptchaEnterprise::V1::RecaptchaEnterpriseService::Client#delete_firewall_policy.
#
def delete_firewall_policy
  # Create a client object. The client can be reused for multiple calls.
  client = Google::Cloud::RecaptchaEnterprise::V1::RecaptchaEnterpriseService::Client.new

  # Create a request. To set request fields, pass in keyword arguments.
  request = Google::Cloud::RecaptchaEnterprise::V1::DeleteFirewallPolicyRequest.new

  # Call the delete_firewall_policy method.
  result = client.delete_firewall_policy request

  # The returned object is of type Google::Protobuf::Empty.
  p result
