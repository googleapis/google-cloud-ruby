        # A common proto for logging HTTP requests. Only contains semantics
        # defined by the HTTP specification. Product-specific logging
        # information MUST be defined in a separate message.
        # @!attribute [rw] request_method
        #   @return [::String]
        #     The request method. Examples: `"GET"`, `"HEAD"`, `"PUT"`, `"POST"`.
        # @!attribute [rw] request_url
        #   @return [::String]
        #     The scheme (http, https), the host name, the path, and the query
        #     portion of the URL that was requested.
        #     Example: `"http://example.com/some/info?color=red"`.
        # @!attribute [rw] request_size
        #   @return [::Integer]
        #     The size of the HTTP request message in bytes, including the request
        #     headers and the request body.
        # @!attribute [rw] status
        #   @return [::Integer]
        #     The response code indicating the status of the response.
        #     Examples: 200, 404.
        # @!attribute [rw] response_size
        #   @return [::Integer]
        #     The size of the HTTP response message sent back to the client, in bytes,
        #     including the response headers and the response body.
        # @!attribute [rw] user_agent
        #   @return [::String]
        #     The user agent sent by the client. Example:
        #     `"Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows 98; Q312461; .NET
        #     CLR 1.0.3705)"`.

        #   @return [::String]
        #     The IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) of the client that issued the HTTP
        #     request. Examples: `"192.168.1.1"`, `"FE80::0202:B3FF:FE1E:8329"`.
        # @!attribute [rw] server_ip
        #   @return [::String]
        #     The IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) of the origin server that the request was

        #   @return [::String]
        #     The referer URL of the request, as defined in
        #     [HTTP/1.1 Header Field
        #     Definitions](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html).
        # @!attribute [rw] latency
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Duration]
        #     The request processing latency on the server, from the time the request was
        #     received until the response was sent.
        # @!attribute [rw] cache_lookup
        #   @return [::Boolean]
        #     Whether or not a cache lookup was attempted.

        #   @return [::Boolean]
        #     Whether or not the response was validated with the origin server before
        #     being served from cache. This field is only meaningful if `cache_hit` is
        #     True.
        # @!attribute [rw] cache_fill_bytes
        #   @return [::Integer]
        #     The number of HTTP response bytes inserted into cache. Set only when a
