        # Represents information regarding an operation.
        # @!attribute [rw] operation_id
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Identity of the operation. This must be unique within the scope of the
        #     service that generated the operation. If the service calls
        #     Check() and Report() on the same operation, the two calls should carry
        #     the same id.
        #
        #     UUID version 4 is recommended, though not required.
        #     In scenarios where an operation is computed from existing information
        #     and an idempotent id is desirable for deduplication purpose, UUID version 5
        #     is recommended. See RFC 4122 for details.
        # @!attribute [rw] operation_name
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Fully qualified name of the operation. Reserved for future use.
        # @!attribute [rw] consumer_id
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Identity of the consumer who is using the service.
        #     This field should be filled in for the operations initiated by a
        #     consumer, but not for service-initiated operations that are
        #     not related to a specific consumer.

        # @!attribute [rw] start_time
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Timestamp]
        #     Required. Start time of the operation.
        # @!attribute [rw] end_time
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Timestamp]
        #     End time of the operation.
        #     Required when the operation is used in
        #     {::Google::Cloud::ServiceControl::V1::ServiceController::Client#report ServiceController.Report},
        #     but optional when the operation is used in

        #
        #     - Labels describing monitored resources as defined in
        #       the service configuration.
        #     - Default labels of metric values. When specified, labels defined in the
        #       metric value override these default.
        #     - The following labels defined by Google Cloud Platform:
        #         - `cloud.googleapis.com/location` describing the location where the
        #            operation happened,
        #         - `servicecontrol.googleapis.com/user_agent` describing the user agent
        #            of the API request,
        #         - `servicecontrol.googleapis.com/service_agent` describing the service
        #            used to handle the API request (e.g. ESP),
        #         - `servicecontrol.googleapis.com/platform` describing the platform
        #            where the API is served, such as App Engine, Compute Engine, or
        #            Kubernetes Engine.

        #     corresponds to a metric defined in the service configuration.
        #     The data type used in the MetricValueSet must agree with
        #     the data type specified in the metric definition.
        #
        #     Within a single operation, it is not allowed to have more than one
        #     MetricValue instances that have the same metric names and identical
        #     label value combinations. If a request has such duplicated MetricValue
        #     instances, the entire request is rejected with
