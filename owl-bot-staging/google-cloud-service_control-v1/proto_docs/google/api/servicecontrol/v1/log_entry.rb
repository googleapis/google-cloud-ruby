        #     `"book_log"`.
        # @!attribute [rw] timestamp
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Timestamp]
        #     The time the event described by the log entry occurred. If
        #     omitted, defaults to operation start time.
        # @!attribute [rw] severity
        #   @return [::Google::Cloud::Logging::Type::LogSeverity]
        #     The severity of the log entry. The default value is
        #     `LogSeverity.DEFAULT`.

        #   @return [::Google::Cloud::ServiceControl::V1::HttpRequest]
        #     Optional. Information about the HTTP request associated with this
        #     log entry, if applicable.
        # @!attribute [rw] trace
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Optional. Resource name of the trace associated with the log entry, if any.
        #     If this field contains a relative resource name, you can assume the name is
        #     relative to `//tracing.googleapis.com`. Example:
        #     `projects/my-projectid/traces/06796866738c859f2f19b7cfb3214824`
        # @!attribute [rw] insert_id
        #   @return [::String]
        #     A unique ID for the log entry used for deduplication. If omitted,
        #     the implementation will generate one based on operation_id.
        # @!attribute [rw] labels
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Map{::String => ::String}]
        #     A set of user-defined (key, value) data that provides additional
        #     information about the log entry.
        # @!attribute [rw] proto_payload
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Any]
        #     The log entry payload, represented as a protocol buffer that is
        #     expressed as a JSON object. The only accepted type currently is

        #     is expressed as a JSON object.
        # @!attribute [rw] operation
        #   @return [::Google::Cloud::ServiceControl::V1::LogEntryOperation]
