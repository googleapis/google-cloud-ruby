    # `Distribution` contains summary statistics for a population of values. It
    # optionally contains a histogram representing the distribution of those values
    # across a set of buckets.
    #
    # The summary statistics are the count, mean, sum of the squared deviation from
    # the mean, the minimum, and the maximum of the set of population of values.
    # The histogram is based on a sequence of buckets and gives a count of values
    # that fall into each bucket. The boundaries of the buckets are given either
    # explicitly or by formulas for buckets of fixed or exponentially increasing
    # widths.
    #
    # Although it is not forbidden, it is generally a bad idea to include
    # non-finite values (infinities or NaNs) in the population of values, as this
    # will render the `mean` and `sum_of_squared_deviation` fields meaningless.
    # @!attribute [rw] count
    #   @return [::Integer]
    #     The number of values in the population. Must be non-negative. This value
    #     must equal the sum of the values in `bucket_counts` if a histogram is
    #     provided.
    # @!attribute [rw] mean
    #   @return [::Float]
    #     The arithmetic mean of the values in the population. If `count` is zero
    #     then this field must be zero.
    # @!attribute [rw] sum_of_squared_deviation
    #   @return [::Float]
    #     The sum of squared deviations from the mean of the values in the
    #     population. For values x_i this is:
    #
    #         Sum[i=1..n]((x_i - mean)^2)
    #
    #     Knuth, "The Art of Computer Programming", Vol. 2, page 232, 3rd edition
    #     describes Welford's method for accumulating this sum in one pass.
    #
    #     If `count` is zero then this field must be zero.
    # @!attribute [rw] range
    #   @return [::Google::Api::Distribution::Range]
    #     If specified, contains the range of the population values. The field
    #     must not be present if the `count` is zero.
    # @!attribute [rw] bucket_options
    #   @return [::Google::Api::Distribution::BucketOptions]
    #     Defines the histogram bucket boundaries. If the distribution does not
    #     contain a histogram, then omit this field.
    # @!attribute [rw] bucket_counts
    #   @return [::Array<::Integer>]
    #     The number of values in each bucket of the histogram, as described in
    #     `bucket_options`. If the distribution does not have a histogram, then omit
    #     this field. If there is a histogram, then the sum of the values in
    #     `bucket_counts` must equal the value in the `count` field of the
    #     distribution.
    #
    #     If present, `bucket_counts` should contain N values, where N is the number
    #     of buckets specified in `bucket_options`. If you supply fewer than N
    #     values, the remaining values are assumed to be 0.
    #
    #     The order of the values in `bucket_counts` follows the bucket numbering
    #     schemes described for the three bucket types. The first value must be the
    #     count for the underflow bucket (number 0). The next N-2 values are the
    #     counts for the finite buckets (number 1 through N-2). The N'th value in
    #     `bucket_counts` is the count for the overflow bucket (number N-1).

    #     Must be in increasing order of `value` field.
