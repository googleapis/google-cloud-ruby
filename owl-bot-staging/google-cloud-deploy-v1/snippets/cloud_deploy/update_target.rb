# Snippet for the update_target call in the CloudDeploy service
#
# This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code
# template only. It will require modifications to work:
# - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
# - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service
# client as shown in https://cloud.google.com/ruby/docs/reference.
#
# This is an auto-generated example demonstrating basic usage of
# Google::Cloud::Deploy::V1::CloudDeploy::Client#update_target.
#
def update_target
  # Create a client object. The client can be reused for multiple calls.
  client = Google::Cloud::Deploy::V1::CloudDeploy::Client.new

  # Create a request. To set request fields, pass in keyword arguments.
  request = Google::Cloud::Deploy::V1::UpdateTargetRequest.new

  # Call the update_target method.
  result = client.update_target request

  # The returned object is of type Gapic::Operation. You can use it to
  # check the status of an operation, cancel it, or wait for results.
  # Here is how to wait for a response.
  result.wait_until_done! timeout: 60
  if result.response?
    p result.response
