        # - The API has a collection of {::Google::Cloud::Vision::V1p3beta1::ProductSet ProductSet} resources, named
        # `projects/*/locations/*/productSets/*`, which acts as a way to put different
        # products into groups to limit identification.
        #
        # In parallel,
        #
        # - The API has a collection of {::Google::Cloud::Vision::V1p3beta1::Product Product} resources, named
        #   `projects/*/locations/*/products/*`
        #
        # - Each {::Google::Cloud::Vision::V1p3beta1::Product Product} has a collection of {::Google::Cloud::Vision::V1p3beta1::ReferenceImage ReferenceImage} resources, named
        #   `projects/*/locations/*/products/*/referenceImages/*`
