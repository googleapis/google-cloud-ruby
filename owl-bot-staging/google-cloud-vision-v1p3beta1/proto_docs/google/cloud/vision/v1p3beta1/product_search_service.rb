        #
        #     The format of the input csv file should be one image per line.
        #     In each line, there are 6 columns.

        #     8. bounding_poly
        #
        #     Columns 1, 3, 4, and 5 are required, other columns are optional. A new
        #     ProductSet/Product with the same id will be created on the fly
        #     if the ProductSet/Product specified by product_set_id/product_id does not
        #     exist.
        #
        #     The image_id field is optional but has to be unique if provided. If it is
        #     empty, we will automatically assign an unique id to the image.
        #
        #     The product_display_name field is optional. If it is empty, a space (" ")
        #     is used as the place holder for the product display_name, which can
        #     be updated later through the realtime API.
        #
        #     If the Product with product_id already exists, the fields
        #     product_display_name, product_category and labels are ignored.
        #
        #     If a Product doesn't exist and needs to be created on the fly, the
        #     product_display_name field refers to
        #     {::Google::Cloud::Vision::V1p3beta1::Product#display_name Product.display_name},
        #     the product_category field refers to
        #     {::Google::Cloud::Vision::V1p3beta1::Product#product_category Product.product_category},
        #     and the labels field refers to [Product.labels][].
        #
        #     Labels (optional) should be a line containing a list of comma-separated
        #     key-value pairs, with the format
        #         "key_1=value_1,key_2=value_2,...,key_n=value_n".
        #
        #     The bounding_poly (optional) field is used to identify one region of
        #     interest from the image in the same manner as CreateReferenceImage. If no
        #     bounding_poly is specified, the system will try to detect regions of
        #     interest automatically.
        #
        #     Note that the pipeline will resize the image if the image resolution is too
        #     large to process (above 20MP).
        #
        #     Also note that at most one bounding_poly is allowed per line. If the image
        #     contains multiple regions of interest, the csv should contain one line per
        #     region of interest.
        #
        #     The bounding_poly column should contain an even number of comma-separated
        #     numbers, with the format "p1_x,p1_y,p2_x,p2_y,...,pn_x,pn_y". Nonnegative
        #     integers should be used for absolute bounding polygons, and float values
        #     in [0, 1] should be used for normalized bounding polygons.
