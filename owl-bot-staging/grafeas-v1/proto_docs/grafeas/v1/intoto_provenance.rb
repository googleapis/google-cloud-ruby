    # Steps taken to build the artifact.
    # For a TaskRun, typically each container corresponds to one step in the
    # recipe.
    # @!attribute [rw] type
    #   @return [::String]
    #     URI indicating what type of recipe was performed. It determines the meaning
    #     of recipe.entryPoint, recipe.arguments, recipe.environment, and materials.
    # @!attribute [rw] defined_in_material
    #   @return [::Integer]
    #     Index in materials containing the recipe steps that are not implied by
    #     recipe.type. For example, if the recipe type were "make", then this would
    #     point to the source containing the Makefile, not the make program itself.
    #     Set to -1 if the recipe doesn't come from a material, as zero is default
    #     unset value for int64.
    # @!attribute [rw] entry_point
    #   @return [::String]
    #     String identifying the entry point into the build.
    #     This is often a path to a configuration file and/or a target label within
    #     that file. The syntax and meaning are defined by recipe.type. For example,
    #     if the recipe type were "make", then this would reference the directory in
    #     which to run make as well as which target to use.
    # @!attribute [rw] arguments
    #   @return [::Array<::Google::Protobuf::Any>]
    #     Collection of all external inputs that influenced the build on top of
    #     recipe.definedInMaterial and recipe.entryPoint. For example, if the recipe
    #     type were "make", then this might be the flags passed to make aside from
    #     the target, which is captured in recipe.entryPoint. Since the arguments
    #     field can greatly vary in structure, depending on the builder and recipe
    #     type, this is of form "Any".
    # @!attribute [rw] environment
    #   @return [::Array<::Google::Protobuf::Any>]
    #     Any other builder-controlled inputs necessary for correctly evaluating the
    #     recipe. Usually only needed for reproducing the build but not evaluated as
    #     part of policy. Since the environment field can greatly vary in structure,
    #     depending on the builder and recipe type, this is of form "Any".

    # complete.
    # @!attribute [rw] arguments
    #   @return [::Boolean]
    #     If true, the builder claims that recipe.arguments is complete, meaning that
    #     all external inputs are properly captured in the recipe.
    # @!attribute [rw] environment
    #   @return [::Boolean]
    #     If true, the builder claims that recipe.environment is claimed to be
    #     complete.
    # @!attribute [rw] materials
    #   @return [::Boolean]
    #     If true, the builder claims that materials are complete, usually through
    #     some controls to prevent network access. Sometimes called "hermetic".

    #   @return [::String]
    #     Identifies the particular build invocation, which can be useful for finding
    #     associated logs or other ad-hoc analysis. The value SHOULD be globally
    #     unique, per in-toto Provenance spec.
    # @!attribute [rw] build_started_on
    #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Timestamp]
    #     The timestamp of when the build started.

    #     The timestamp of when the build completed.

    #   @return [::Grafeas::V1::Completeness]
    #     Indicates that the builder claims certain fields in this message to be
    #     complete.
    # @!attribute [rw] reproducible
    #   @return [::Boolean]
    #     If true, the builder claims that running the recipe on materials will
    #     produce bit-for-bit identical output.

    #     dependencies, build tools, base images, and so on. This is considered to be
    #     incomplete unless metadata.completeness.materials is true. Unset or null is
    #     equivalent to empty.
