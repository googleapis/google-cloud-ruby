    #     Serialized JSON representation of the provenance, used in generating the
    #     build signature in the corresponding build note. After verifying the
    #     signature, `provenance_bytes` can be unmarshalled and compared to the
    #     provenance to confirm that it is unchanged. A base64-encoded string
    #     representation of the provenance bytes is used for the signature in order
    #     to interoperate with openssl which expects this format for signature
    #     verification.
    #
    #     The serialized form is captured both to avoid ambiguity in how the
    #     provenance is marshalled to json as well to prevent incompatibilities with
    #     future changes.
