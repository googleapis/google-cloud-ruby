      #   @return [::String]
      #     URI indicating what type of recipe was performed. It determines the

      #   @return [::Integer]
      #     Index in materials containing the recipe steps that are not implied by

      #     point to the source containing the Makefile, not the make program itself.

      #     String identifying the entry point into the build.
      #     This is often a path to a configuration file and/or a target label within
      #     that file. The syntax and meaning are defined by recipe.type. For
      #     example, if the recipe type were "make", then this would reference the

      #     recipe type were "make", then this might be the flags passed to make
      #     aside from the target, which is captured in recipe.entryPoint. Depending
