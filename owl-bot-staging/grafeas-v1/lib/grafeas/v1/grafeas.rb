    # [Grafeas](https://grafeas.io) API.
    #
    # Retrieves analysis results of Cloud components such as Docker container
    # images.
    #
    # Analysis results are stored as a series of occurrences. An `Occurrence`
    # contains information about a specific analysis instance on a resource. An
    # occurrence refers to a `Note`. A note contains details describing the
    # analysis and is generally stored in a separate project, called a `Provider`.
    # Multiple occurrences can refer to the same note.
    #
    # For example, an SSL vulnerability could affect multiple images. In this case,
    # there would be one note for the vulnerability and an occurrence for each
    # image with the vulnerability referring to that note.
    #
