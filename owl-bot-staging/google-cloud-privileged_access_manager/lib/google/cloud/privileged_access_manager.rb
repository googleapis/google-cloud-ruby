      # Create a new client object for PrivilegedAccessManager.
      #
      # By default, this returns an instance of
      # [Google::Cloud::PrivilegedAccessManager::V1::PrivilegedAccessManager::Client](https://cloud.google.com/ruby/docs/reference/google-cloud-privileged_access_manager-v1/latest/Google-Cloud-PrivilegedAccessManager-V1-PrivilegedAccessManager-Client)
      # for a gRPC client for version V1 of the API.
      # However, you can specify a different API version by passing it in the
      # `version` parameter. If the PrivilegedAccessManager service is
      # supported by that API version, and the corresponding gem is available, the
      # appropriate versioned client will be returned.
      # You can also specify a different transport by passing `:rest` or `:grpc` in
      # the `transport` parameter.
      #
      # ## About PrivilegedAccessManager
      #
      # This API allows customers to manage temporary, request based privileged
      # access to their resources.
      #
      # It defines the following resource model:
      #
      # * A collection of `Entitlement` resources. An entitlement allows configuring
      #   (among other things):
      #
      #   * Some kind of privileged access that users can request.
      #   * A set of users called _requesters_ who can request this access.
      #   * A maximum duration for which the access can be requested.
      #   * An optional approval workflow which must be satisfied before access is
      #     granted.
      #
      # * A collection of `Grant` resources. A grant is a request by a requester to
      #   get the privileged access specified in an entitlement for some duration.
      #
      #   After the approval workflow as specified in the entitlement is satisfied,
      #   the specified access is given to the requester. The access is automatically
      #   taken back after the requested duration is over.
      #
      # @param version [::String, ::Symbol] The API version to connect to. Optional.
      #   Defaults to `:v1`.
      # @param transport [:grpc, :rest] The transport to use. Defaults to `:grpc`.
      # @return [::Object] A client object for the specified version.

      #   The library name as recorded in instrumentation and logging.
      # * `lib_version` (*type:* `String`) -
      #   The library version as recorded in instrumentation and logging.
      # * `interceptors` (*type:* `Array<GRPC::ClientInterceptor>`) -
