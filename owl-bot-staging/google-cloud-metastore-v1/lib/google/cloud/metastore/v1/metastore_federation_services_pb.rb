          # Configures and manages metastore federation services.
          # Dataproc Metastore Federation Service allows federating a collection of
          # backend metastores like BigQuery, Dataplex Lakes, and other Dataproc
          # Metastores. The Federation Service exposes a gRPC URL through which metadata
          # from the backend metastores are served at query time.
          #
          # The Dataproc Metastore Federation API defines the following resource model:
          # * The service works with a collection of Google Cloud projects.
          # * Each project has a collection of available locations.
          # * Each location has a collection of federations.
          # * Dataproc Metastore Federations are resources with names of the
          # form:
          # `projects/{project_number}/locations/{location_id}/federations/{federation_id}`.
