        # @!attribute [rw] filter
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Optional. An expression for filtering the results of the request. Filter
        #     rules are case insensitive. The fields eligible for filtering are:
        #
        #       * `name`
        #       * `annotations`
        #
        #     Examples of using a filter:
        #
        #      To filter the results of your request to packages with the name
        #      `my-package` in project `my-project` in the `us-central` region, in
        #      repository `my-repo`, append the following filter expression to your
        #      request:
        #
        #       * `name="projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/repositories/my-repo/packages/my-package"`
        #
        #      You can also use wildcards to match any number of characters before or
        #      after the value:
        #
        #       * `name="projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/repositories/my-repo/packages/my-*"`
        #       * `name="projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/repositories/my-repo/packages/*package"`
        #       * `name="projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/repositories/my-repo/packages/*pack*"`
        #
        #      To filter the results of your request to packages with the annotation
        #      key-value pair [`external_link`: `external_link_value`], append the
        #      following filter expression to your request":
        #
        #       * `"annotations.external_link:external_link_value"`
        #
        #      To filter the results just for a specific annotation key `external_link`,
        #      append the following filter expression to your request:
        #
        #       * `"annotations.external_link"`
        #
        #      If the annotation key or value contains special characters, you can escape
        #      them by surrounding the value with backticks. For example, to filter the
        #      results of your request to packages with the annotation key-value pair
        #      [`external.link`:`https://example.com/my-package`], append the following
        #      filter expression to your request:
        #
        #       * `` "annotations.`external.link`:`https://example.com/my-package`" ``
        #
        #      You can also filter with annotations with a wildcard to
        #      match any number of characters before or after the value:
        #
        #       * `` "annotations.*_link:`*example.com*`" ``
        # @!attribute [rw] order_by
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Optional. The field to order the results by.
