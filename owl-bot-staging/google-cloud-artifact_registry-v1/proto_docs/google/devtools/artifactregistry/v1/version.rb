        # The body of a version resource. A version resource represents a
        # collection of components, such as files and other data. This may correspond
        # to a version in many package management schemes.
        # @!attribute [rw] name
        #   @return [::String]
        #     The name of the version, for example:
        #     `projects/p1/locations/us-central1/repositories/repo1/packages/pkg1/versions/art1`.
        #     If the package or version ID parts contain slashes, the slashes are
        #     escaped.
        # @!attribute [rw] description
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Optional. Description of the version, as specified in its metadata.
        # @!attribute [rw] create_time
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Timestamp]
        #     The time when the version was created.
        # @!attribute [rw] update_time
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Timestamp]
        #     The time when the version was last updated.
        # @!attribute [rw] related_tags
        #   @return [::Array<::Google::Cloud::ArtifactRegistry::V1::Tag>]
        #     Output only. A list of related tags. Will contain up to 100 tags that
        #     reference this version.
        # @!attribute [r] metadata
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Struct]
        #     Output only. Repository-specific Metadata stored against this version.
        #     The fields returned are defined by the underlying repository-specific
        #     resource. Currently, the resources could be:
        #     {::Google::Cloud::ArtifactRegistry::V1::DockerImage DockerImage}

        # @!attribute [rw] annotations
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Map{::String => ::String}]
        #     Optional. Client specified annotations.

        #     The view that should be returned in the response.
        # @!attribute [rw] order_by
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Optional. The field to order the results by.
        # @!attribute [rw] filter
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Optional. An expression for filtering the results of the request. Filter
        #     rules are case insensitive. The fields eligible for filtering are:
        #
        #       * `name`
        #       * `annotations`
        #
        #      Examples of using a filter:
        #
        #      To filter the results of your request to versions with the name
        #      `my-version` in project `my-project` in the `us-central` region, in
        #      repository `my-repo`, append the following filter expression to your
        #      request:
        #
        #       * `name="projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/repositories/my-repo/packages/my-package/versions/my-version"`
        #
        #      You can also use wildcards to match any number of characters before or
        #      after the value:
        #
        #       * `name="projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/repositories/my-repo/packages/my-package/versions/*version"`
        #       * `name="projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/repositories/my-repo/packages/my-package/versions/my*"`
        #       * `name="projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/repositories/my-repo/packages/my-package/versions/*version*"`
        #
        #      To filter the results of your request to versions with the annotation
        #      key-value pair [`external_link`: `external_link_value`], append the
        #      following filter expression to your request:
        #
        #       * `"annotations.external_link:external_link_value"`
        #
        #      To filter just for a specific annotation key `external_link`, append the
        #      following filter expression to your request:
        #
        #       * `"annotations.external_link"`
        #
        #      If the annotation key or value contains special characters, you can escape
        #      them by surrounding the value with backticks. For example, to filter the
        #      results of your request to versions with the annotation key-value pair
        #      [`external.link`:`https://example.com/my-version`], append the following
        #      filter expression to your request:
        #
        #       * `` "annotations.`external.link`:`https://example.com/my-version`" ``
        #
        #      You can also filter with annotations with a wildcard to
        #      match any number of characters before or after the value:
        #
        #       * `` "annotations.*_link:`*example.com*`" ``
