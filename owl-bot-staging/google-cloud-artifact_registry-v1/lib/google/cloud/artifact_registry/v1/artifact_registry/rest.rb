        # The Artifact Registry API service.
        #
        # Artifact Registry is an artifact management system for storing artifacts
        # from different package management systems.
        #
        # The resources managed by this API are:
        #
        # * Repositories, which group packages and their data.
        # * Packages, which group versions and their tags.
        # * Versions, which are specific forms of a package.
        # * Tags, which represent alternative names for versions.
        # * Files, which contain content and are optionally associated with a Package
        #   or Version.
        #
        # To load this service and instantiate a REST client:
        #
        #     require "google/cloud/artifact_registry/v1/artifact_registry/rest"
        #     client = ::Google::Cloud::ArtifactRegistry::V1::ArtifactRegistry::Rest::Client.new
        #
        module ArtifactRegistry
          # Client for the REST transport
          module Rest
