# Snippet for the delete_security_health_analytics_custom_module call in the SecurityCenterManagement service
#
# This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code
# template only. It will require modifications to work:
# - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
# - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service
# client as shown in https://cloud.google.com/ruby/docs/reference.
#
# This is an auto-generated example demonstrating basic usage of
# Google::Cloud::SecurityCenterManagement::V1::SecurityCenterManagement::Client#delete_security_health_analytics_custom_module.

def delete_security_health_analytics_custom_module
  # Create a client object. The client can be reused for multiple calls.

  # Create a request. To set request fields, pass in keyword arguments.
  request = Google::Cloud::SecurityCenterManagement::V1::DeleteSecurityHealthAnalyticsCustomModuleRequest.new

  # Call the delete_security_health_analytics_custom_module method.
  result = client.delete_security_health_analytics_custom_module request

  # The returned object is of type Google::Protobuf::Empty.
