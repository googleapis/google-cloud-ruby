        # @!attribute [rw] containers
        #   @return [::Array<::Google::Cloud::Run::V2::Container>]
        #     Holds the single container that defines the unit of execution for this
        #     task.
        # @!attribute [rw] volumes
        #   @return [::Array<::Google::Cloud::Run::V2::Volume>]
        #     A list of Volumes to make available to containers.
        # @!attribute [rw] max_retries
        #   @return [::Integer]
        #     Number of retries allowed per Task, before marking this Task failed.
        #     Defaults to 3.
        # @!attribute [rw] timeout
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Duration]
        #     Max allowed time duration the Task may be active before the system will
        #     actively try to mark it failed and kill associated containers. This applies
        #     per attempt of a task, meaning each retry can run for the full timeout.
        #     Defaults to 600 seconds.
        # @!attribute [rw] service_account
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Email address of the IAM service account associated with the Task of a
        #     Job. The service account represents the identity of the
        #     running task, and determines what permissions the task has. If
        #     not provided, the task will use the project's default service account.
        # @!attribute [rw] execution_environment
        #   @return [::Google::Cloud::Run::V2::ExecutionEnvironment]
        #     The execution environment being used to host this Task.
        # @!attribute [rw] encryption_key
        #   @return [::String]
        #     A reference to a customer managed encryption key (CMEK) to use to encrypt
        #     this container image. For more information, go to
        #     https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/securing/using-cmek

        #   @return [::Google::Cloud::Run::V2::VpcAccess]
        #     VPC Access configuration to use for this Task. For more information,
