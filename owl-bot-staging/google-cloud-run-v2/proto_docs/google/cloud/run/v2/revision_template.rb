        # @!attribute [rw] revision
        #   @return [::String]
        #     The unique name for the revision. If this field is omitted, it will be
        #     automatically generated based on the Service name.

        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Map{::String => ::String}]
        #     Unstructured key value map that can be used to organize and categorize
        #     objects.

        #     be used to filter, or break down billing charges by team, component,

        #     Max allowed time for an instance to respond to a request.

        #   @return [::String]
        #     Email address of the IAM service account associated with the revision of
        #     the service. The service account represents the identity of the running
        #     revision, and determines what permissions the revision has. If not
        #     provided, the revision will use the project's default service account.
        # @!attribute [rw] containers
        #   @return [::Array<::Google::Cloud::Run::V2::Container>]
