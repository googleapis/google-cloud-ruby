        # This stateless API provides automatic suggestions for natural language
        # queries for the data sources in the provided project and location.
        #
        # The service provides a resourceless operation `suggestQueries` that can be
        # called to get a list of suggestions for a given incomplete query and scope
        # (or list of scopes) under which the query is to be interpreted.
        #
        # There are two types of suggestions, ENTITY for single entity suggestions
        # and TEMPLATE for full sentences. By default, both types are returned.
        #
        # Example Request:
        # ```
        # GetSuggestions({
        #   parent: "locations/us/projects/my-project"
        #   scopes:
        #   "//bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/my-project/datasets/my-dataset/tables/my-table"
        #   query: "top it"
        # })
        # ```
        #
        # The service will retrieve information based on the given scope(s) and give
        # suggestions based on that (e.g. "top item" for "top it" if "item" is a known
        # dimension for the provided scope).
        # ```
