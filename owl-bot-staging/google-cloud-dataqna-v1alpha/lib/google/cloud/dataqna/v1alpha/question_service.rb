        ##
        # Service to interpret natural language queries.
        # The service allows to create `Question` resources that are interpreted and
        # are filled with one or more interpretations if the question could be
        # interpreted. Once a `Question` resource is created and has at least one
        # interpretation, an interpretation can be chosen for execution, which
        # triggers a query to the backend (for BigQuery, it will create a job).
        # Upon successful execution of that interpretation, backend specific
        # information will be returned so that the client can retrieve the results
        # from the backend.
        #
        # The `Question` resources are named `projects/*/locations/*/questions/*`.
        #
        # The `Question` resource has a singletion sub-resource `UserFeedback` named
        # `projects/*/locations/*/questions/*/userFeedback`, which allows access to
        # user feedback.
