      # for a gRPC client for version V1alpha of the API.

      # ## About AutoSuggestionService
      #
      # This stateless API provides automatic suggestions for natural language
      # queries for the data sources in the provided project and location.
      #
      # The service provides a resourceless operation `suggestQueries` that can be
      # called to get a list of suggestions for a given incomplete query and scope
      # (or list of scopes) under which the query is to be interpreted.
      #
      # There are two types of suggestions, ENTITY for single entity suggestions
      # and TEMPLATE for full sentences. By default, both types are returned.
      #
      # Example Request:
      # ```
      # GetSuggestions({
      #   parent: "locations/us/projects/my-project"
      #   scopes:
      #   "//bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/my-project/datasets/my-dataset/tables/my-table"
      #   query: "top it"
      # })
      # ```
      #
      # The service will retrieve information based on the given scope(s) and give
      # suggestions based on that (e.g. "top item" for "top it" if "item" is a known
      # dimension for the provided scope).
      # ```
      # suggestions {

      # ## About QuestionService
      #
      # Service to interpret natural language queries.
      # The service allows to create `Question` resources that are interpreted and
      # are filled with one or more interpretations if the question could be
      # interpreted. Once a `Question` resource is created and has at least one
      # interpretation, an interpretation can be chosen for execution, which
      # triggers a query to the backend (for BigQuery, it will create a job).
      # Upon successful execution of that interpretation, backend specific
      # information will be returned so that the client can retrieve the results
      # from the backend.
      #
      # The `Question` resources are named `projects/*/locations/*/questions/*`.
      #
      # The `Question` resource has a singletion sub-resource `UserFeedback` named
      # `projects/*/locations/*/questions/*/userFeedback`, which allows access to
      # user feedback.
      #
      # @param version [::String, ::Symbol] The API version to connect to. Optional.
      #   Defaults to `:v1alpha`.
      # @return [::Object] A client object for the specified version.
