# This is an auto-generated example demonstrating basic usage of

# modification in order to execute successfully.

  # Create a client object. The client can be reused for multiple calls.
  client = Google::Cloud::Logging::V2::ConfigService::Client.new

  # Create a request. To set request fields, pass in keyword arguments.

  # Call the list_buckets method.
