        # @!attribute [rw] log_name
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Optional. A default log resource name that is assigned to all log entries
        #     in `entries` that do not specify a value for `log_name`:
        #
        #         "projects/[PROJECT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]"

        #     The permission `logging.logEntries.create` is needed on each project,

        #     individual log entry.
        # @!attribute [rw] resource
        #   @return [::Google::Api::MonitoredResource]
        #     Optional. A default monitored resource object that is assigned to all log
        #     entries in `entries` that do not specify a value for `resource`. Example:
        #
        #         { "type": "gce_instance",

        # @!attribute [rw] labels
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Map{::String => ::String}]
        #     Optional. Default labels that are added to the `labels` field of all log
        #     entries in `entries`. If a log entry already has a label with the same key
        #     as a label in this parameter, then the log entry's label is not changed.
        #     See {::Google::Cloud::Logging::V2::LogEntry LogEntry}.
        # @!attribute [rw] entries
        #   @return [::Array<::Google::Cloud::Logging::V2::LogEntry>]
        #     Required. The log entries to send to Logging. The order of log
        #     entries in this list does not matter. Values supplied in this method's
        #     `log_name`, `resource`, and `labels` fields are copied into those log
        #     entries in this list that do not include values for their corresponding
        #     fields. For more information, see the
        #     {::Google::Cloud::Logging::V2::LogEntry LogEntry} type.
        #
        #     If the `timestamp` or `insert_id` fields are missing in log entries, then
        #     this method supplies the current time or a unique identifier, respectively.
        #     The supplied values are chosen so that, among the log entries that did not
        #     supply their own values, the entries earlier in the list will sort before
        #     the entries later in the list. See the `entries.list` method.
        #
        #     Log entries with timestamps that are more than the
        #     [logs retention period](https://cloud.google.com/logging/quota-policy) in
        #     the past or more than 24 hours in the future will not be available when
        #     calling `entries.list`. However, those log entries can still be [exported
        #     with
        #     LogSinks](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/api/tasks/exporting-logs).
        #
        #     To improve throughput and to avoid exceeding the
        #     [quota limit](https://cloud.google.com/logging/quota-policy) for calls to
        #     `entries.write`, you should try to include several log entries in this
        #     list, rather than calling this method for each individual log entry.
        # @!attribute [rw] partial_success
        #   @return [::Boolean]
        #     Optional. Whether valid entries should be written even if some other
        #     entries fail due to INVALID_ARGUMENT or PERMISSION_DENIED errors. If any
        #     entry is not written, then the response status is the error associated
        #     with one of the failed entries and the response includes error details
        #     keyed by the entries' zero-based index in the `entries.write` method.
        # @!attribute [rw] dry_run
        #   @return [::Boolean]
        #     Optional. If true, the request should expect normal response, but the
        #     entries won't be persisted nor exported. Useful for checking whether the
        #     logging API endpoints are working properly before sending valuable data.
