        #     Output only. An IAM identity&mdash;a service account or group&mdash;under
        #     which Cloud Logging writes the exported log entries to the sink's
        #     destination. This field is either set by specifying

        #     value of `unique_writer_identity` in those methods.
        #
        #     Until you grant this identity write-access to the destination, log entry
        #     exports from this sink will fail. For more information, see [Granting

        #     Resource](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-roles-to-service-accounts#granting_access_to_a_service_account_for_a_resource).
        #     Consult the destination service's documentation to determine the
        #     appropriate IAM roles to assign to the identity.
        #

        #     the sink cannot have a writer_identity and no additional permissions are

        #     log entries from all the projects, folders, and billing accounts contained
        #     in the sink's parent resource are also available for export. Whether a
        #     particular log entry from the children is exported depends on the sink's
        #     filter expression.
        #
        #     For example, if this field is true, then the filter
        #     `resource.type=gce_instance` would export all Compute Engine VM instance
        #     log entries from all projects in the sink's parent.
        #
        #     To only export entries from certain child projects, filter on the project

        #       logName:("projects/test-project1/" OR "projects/test-project2/") AND
