          # to improve the accuracy for specific words and phrases, for example, if
          # specific commands are typically spoken by the user. This can also be used

          # of words that represent common concepts that occur in natural language. For
          # example, rather than providing a phrase hint for every month of the
          # year (e.g. "i was born in january", "i was born in febuary", ...), use the
          # pre-built `$MONTH` class improves the likelihood of correctly transcribing
          # audio that includes months (e.g. "i was born in $month").
          # To refer to pre-built classes, use the class' symbol prepended with `$`
          # e.g. `$MONTH`. To refer to custom classes that were defined inline in the
          # request, set the class's `custom_class_id` to a string unique to all class
          # resources and inline classes. Then use the class' id wrapped in $`{...}`
          # e.g. "$\\{my-months}". To refer to custom classes resources, use the class'
          # id wrapped in `${}` (e.g. `${my-months}`).
