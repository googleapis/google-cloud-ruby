      # ## About ProductSearch
      #
      # Manages Products and ProductSets of reference images for use in product
      # search. It uses the following resource model:
      #
      # - The API has a collection of ProductSet resources, named
      # `projects/*/locations/*/productSets/*`, which acts as a way to put different
      # products into groups to limit identification.
      #
      # In parallel,
      #
      # - The API has a collection of Product resources, named
      #   `projects/*/locations/*/products/*`
      #
      # - Each Product has a collection of ReferenceImage resources, named
      #   `projects/*/locations/*/products/*/referenceImages/*`
      #
      # @param version [::String, ::Symbol] The API version to connect to. Optional.
      #   Defaults to `:v1`.
      # @return [ProductSearch::Client] A client object for the specified version.
