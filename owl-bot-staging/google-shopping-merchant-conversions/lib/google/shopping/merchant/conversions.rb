        # Create a new client object for ConversionSourcesService.
        #
        # By default, this returns an instance of
        # [Google::Shopping::Merchant::Conversions::V1beta::ConversionSourcesService::Client](https://rubydoc.info/gems/google-shopping-merchant-conversions-v1beta/Google/Shopping/Merchant/Conversions/V1beta/ConversionSourcesService/Client)
        # for a gRPC client for version V1beta of the API.
        # However, you can specify a different API version by passing it in the
        # `version` parameter. If the ConversionSourcesService service is
        # supported by that API version, and the corresponding gem is available, the
        # appropriate versioned client will be returned.
        # You can also specify a different transport by passing `:rest` or `:grpc` in
        # the `transport` parameter.
        #

        # @param version [::String, ::Symbol] The API version to connect to. Optional.
