          # This API allows users to manage their BigQuery reservations.
          #
          # A reservation provides computational resource guarantees, in the form of
          # [slots](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/slots), to users. A slot is a
          # unit of computational power in BigQuery, and serves as the basic unit of
          # parallelism. In a scan of a multi-partitioned table, a single slot operates
          # on a single partition of the table. A reservation resource exists as a child
          # resource of the admin project and location, e.g.:
          #   `projects/myproject/locations/US/reservations/reservationName`.
          #
          # A capacity commitment is a way to purchase compute capacity for BigQuery jobs
          # (in the form of slots) with some committed period of usage. A capacity
          # commitment resource exists as a child resource of the admin project and
          # location, e.g.:
          #   `projects/myproject/locations/US/capacityCommitments/id`.
          #
