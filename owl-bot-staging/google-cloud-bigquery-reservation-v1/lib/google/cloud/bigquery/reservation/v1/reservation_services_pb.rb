            # This API allows users to manage their BigQuery reservations.
            #
            # A reservation provides computational resource guarantees, in the form of
            # [slots](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/slots), to users. A slot is a
            # unit of computational power in BigQuery, and serves as the basic unit of
            # parallelism. In a scan of a multi-partitioned table, a single slot operates
            # on a single partition of the table. A reservation resource exists as a child
            # resource of the admin project and location, e.g.:
            #   `projects/myproject/locations/US/reservations/reservationName`.
            #
            # A capacity commitment is a way to purchase compute capacity for BigQuery jobs
            # (in the form of slots) with some committed period of usage. A capacity
            # commitment resource exists as a child resource of the admin project and
            # location, e.g.:
            #   `projects/myproject/locations/US/capacityCommitments/id`.

              # for all jobs of the matching type.
              #
              # Different assignments can be created on different levels of the
              # projects, folders or organization hierarchy.  During query execution,
              # the assignment is looked up at the project, folder and organization levels
              # in that order. The first assignment found is applied to the query.

              # When creating assignments, it does not matter if other assignments exist at
              # higher levels.

              #

              #   reservations.
              #
              # "None" assignments represent an absence of the assignment. Projects
              # assigned to None use on-demand pricing. To create a "None" assignment, use

              # and the project that owns this reservation.
              #
              # Returns `google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT` when location of the assignment
              # does not match location of the reservation.
