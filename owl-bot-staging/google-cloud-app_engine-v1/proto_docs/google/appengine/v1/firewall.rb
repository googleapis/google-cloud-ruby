        # A single firewall rule that is evaluated against incoming traffic

        # @!attribute [rw] priority
        #   @return [::Integer]
        #     A positive integer between [1, Int32.MaxValue-1] that defines the order of
        #     rule evaluation. Rules with the lowest priority are evaluated first.
        #
        #     A default rule at priority Int32.MaxValue matches all IPv4 and IPv6 traffic
        #     when no previous rule matches. Only the action of this rule can be modified
        #     by the user.
        # @!attribute [rw] action
        #   @return [::Google::Cloud::AppEngine::V1::FirewallRule::Action]
        #     The action to take on matched requests.
        # @!attribute [rw] source_range
        #   @return [::String]
        #     IP address or range, defined using CIDR notation, of requests that this
        #     rule applies to. You can use the wildcard character "*" to match all IPs
        #     equivalent to "0/0" and "::/0" together.
        #     Examples: `192.168.1.1` or `192.168.0.0/16` or `2001:db8::/32`
        #               or `2001:0db8:0000:0042:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`.

        #     <p>Truncation will be silently performed on addresses which are not
        #     properly truncated. For example, `1.2.3.4/24` is accepted as the same
        #     address as `1.2.3.0/24`. Similarly, for IPv6, `2001:db8::1/32` is accepted
        #     as the same address as `2001:db8::/32`.
        # @!attribute [rw] description
        #   @return [::String]
        #     An optional string description of this rule.
        #     This field has a maximum length of 100 characters.
