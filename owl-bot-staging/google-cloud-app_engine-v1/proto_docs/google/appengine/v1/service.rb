        # A Service resource is a logical component of an application that can share
        # state and communicate in a secure fashion with other services.
        # For example, an application that handles customer requests might
        # include separate services to handle tasks such as backend data
        # analysis or API requests from mobile devices. Each service has a
        # collection of versions that define a specific set of code used to
        # implement the functionality of that service.
        # @!attribute [rw] name
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Full path to the Service resource in the API.
        #     Example: `apps/myapp/services/default`.
        # @!attribute [rw] id
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Relative name of the service within the application.
        #     Example: `default`.
        # @!attribute [rw] split
        #   @return [::Google::Cloud::AppEngine::V1::TrafficSplit]
        #     Mapping that defines fractional HTTP traffic diversion to
        #     different versions within the service.

        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Map{::String => ::String}]
        #     A set of labels to apply to this service. Labels are key/value pairs that
        #     describe the service and all resources that belong to it (e.g.,
        #     versions). The labels can be used to search and group resources, and are
        #     propagated to the usage and billing reports, enabling fine-grain analysis
        #     of costs. An example of using labels is to tag resources belonging to
        #     different environments (e.g., "env=prod", "env=qa").
        #

        #     or an international character. Each service can have at most 32 labels.
