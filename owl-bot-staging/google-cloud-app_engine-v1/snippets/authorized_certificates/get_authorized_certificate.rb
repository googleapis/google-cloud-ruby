# - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service
# client as shown in https://cloud.google.com/ruby/docs/reference.

# This is an auto-generated example demonstrating basic usage of
# Google::Cloud::AppEngine::V1::AuthorizedCertificates::Client#get_authorized_certificate.

def get_authorized_certificate
  # Create a client object. The client can be reused for multiple calls.
  client = Google::Cloud::AppEngine::V1::AuthorizedCertificates::Client.new

  request = Google::Cloud::AppEngine::V1::GetAuthorizedCertificateRequest.new

  # Call the get_authorized_certificate method.
  result = client.get_authorized_certificate request

  # The returned object is of type Google::Cloud::AppEngine::V1::AuthorizedCertificate.
