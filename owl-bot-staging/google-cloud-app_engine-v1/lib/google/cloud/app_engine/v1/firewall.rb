        ##
        # Firewall resources are used to define a collection of access control rules
        # for an Application. Each rule is defined with a position which specifies
        # the rule's order in the sequence of rules, an IP range to be matched against
        # requests, and an action to take upon matching requests.
        #
        # Every request is evaluated against the Firewall rules in priority order.
        # Processesing stops at the first rule which matches the request's IP address.
        # A final rule always specifies an action that applies to all remaining
        # IP addresses. The default final rule for a newly-created application will be
        # set to "allow" if not otherwise specified by the user.
