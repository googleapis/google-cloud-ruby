        # Configures and manages metastore services.
        # Metastore services are fully managed, highly available, autoscaled,
        # autohealing, OSS-native deployments of technical metadata management
        # software. Each metastore service exposes a network endpoint through which
        # metadata queries are served. Metadata queries can originate from a variety
        # of sources, including Apache Hive, Apache Presto, and Apache Spark.
        #
        # The Dataproc Metastore API defines the following resource model:
        #
        # * The service works with a collection of Google Cloud projects, named:
        # `/projects/*`
        # * Each project has a collection of available locations, named: `/locations/*`
        #   (a location must refer to a Google Cloud `region`)
        # * Each location has a collection of services, named: `/services/*`
        # * Dataproc Metastore services are resources with names of the form:
        #
        #   `/projects/{project_number}/locations/{location_id}/services/{service_id}`.
        #
        # To load this service and instantiate a REST client:
        #
        #     require "google/cloud/metastore/v1beta/dataproc_metastore/rest"
        #     client = ::Google::Cloud::Metastore::V1beta::DataprocMetastore::Rest::Client.new
        #
        module DataprocMetastore
          # Client for the REST transport
          module Rest
          end
        end
      end
