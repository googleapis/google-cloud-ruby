        # Looks up a service by its name, returns the service and its endpoints.
        # @!attribute [rw] name
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Required. The name of the service to resolve.
        # @!attribute [rw] max_endpoints
        #   @return [::Integer]
        #     Optional. The maximum number of endpoints to return. Defaults to 25.
        #     Maximum is 100. If a value less than one is specified, the Default is used.
        #     If a value greater than the Maximum is specified, the Maximum is used.
        # @!attribute [rw] endpoint_filter
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Optional. The filter applied to the endpoints of the resolved service.
        #
        #     General `filter` string syntax:
        #     `<field> <operator> <value> (<logical connector>)`
        #
        #     *   `<field>` can be `name`, `address`, `port`, or `annotations.<key>` for
        #         map field
        #     *   `<operator>` can be `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `!=`, `=`, `:`. Of which `:`
        #         means `HAS`, and is roughly the same as `=`
        #     *   `<value>` must be the same data type as field
        #     *   `<logical connector>` can be `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`
        #
        #     Examples of valid filters:
        #
        #     *   `annotations.owner` returns endpoints that have a annotation with the
        #         key `owner`, this is the same as `annotations:owner`
        #     *   `annotations.protocol=gRPC` returns endpoints that have key/value
        #         `protocol=gRPC`
        #     *   `address=192.108.1.105` returns endpoints that have this address
        #     *   `port>8080` returns endpoints that have port number larger than 8080
        #     *
        #     `name>projects/my-project/locations/us-east1/namespaces/my-namespace/services/my-service/endpoints/endpoint-c`
        #         returns endpoints that have name that is alphabetically later than the
        #         string, so "endpoint-e" is returned but "endpoint-a" is not
        #     *
        #     `name=projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/namespaces/my-namespace/services/my-service/endpoints/ep-1`
        #          returns the endpoint that has an endpoint_id equal to `ep-1`
        #     *   `annotations.owner!=sd AND annotations.foo=bar` returns endpoints that
        #         have `owner` in annotation key but value is not `sd` AND have
        #         key/value `foo=bar`
        #     *   `doesnotexist.foo=bar` returns an empty list. Note that endpoint
        #         doesn't have a field called "doesnotexist". Since the filter does not
        #         match any endpoint, it returns no results
        #
        #     For more information about filtering, see
        #     [API Filtering](https://aip.dev/160).
