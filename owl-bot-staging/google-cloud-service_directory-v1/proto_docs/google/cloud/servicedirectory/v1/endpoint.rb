        # An individual endpoint that provides a
        # {::Google::Cloud::ServiceDirectory::V1::Service service}. The service must
        # already exist to create an endpoint.
        # @!attribute [rw] name
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Immutable. The resource name for the endpoint in the format
        #     `projects/*/locations/*/namespaces/*/services/*/endpoints/*`.
        # @!attribute [rw] address
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Optional. An IPv4 or IPv6 address. Service Directory rejects bad addresses
        #     like:
        #
        #     *   `8.8.8`
        #     *   `8.8.8.8:53`
        #     *   `test:bad:address`
        #     *   `[::1]`
        #     *   `[::1]:8080`
        #
        #     Limited to 45 characters.
        # @!attribute [rw] port
        #   @return [::Integer]
        #     Optional. Service Directory rejects values outside of `[0, 65535]`.
        # @!attribute [rw] annotations
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Map{::String => ::String}]
        #     Optional. Annotations for the endpoint. This data can be consumed by
        #     service clients.
        #
        #     Restrictions:
        #
        #     *   The entire annotations dictionary may contain up to 512 characters,
        #         spread accoss all key-value pairs. Annotations that go beyond this
        #         limit are rejected
        #     *   Valid annotation keys have two segments: an optional prefix and name,
        #         separated by a slash (/). The name segment is required and must be 63
        #         characters or less, beginning and ending with an alphanumeric character
        #         ([a-z0-9A-Z]) with dashes (-), underscores (_), dots (.), and
        #         alphanumerics between. The prefix is optional. If specified, the prefix
        #         must be a DNS subdomain: a series of DNS labels separated by dots (.),
        #         not longer than 253 characters in total, followed by a slash (/)
        #         Annotations that fails to meet these requirements are rejected.
        #
        #     Note: This field is equivalent to the `metadata` field in the v1beta1 API.
        #     They have the same syntax and read/write to the same location in Service
        #     Directory.
        # @!attribute [rw] network
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Immutable. The Google Compute Engine network (VPC) of the endpoint in the
        #     format `projects/<project number>/locations/global/networks/*`.
        #
        #     The project must be specified by project number (project id is rejected).
        #     Incorrectly formatted networks are rejected, we also check to make sure
        #     that you have the servicedirectory.networks.attach permission on the
        #     project specified.
        # @!attribute [r] uid
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Output only. The globally unique identifier of the endpoint in the UUID4
        #     format.
