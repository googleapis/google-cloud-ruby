            #   @return [::Boolean]
            #     Optional. Whether to enable nested virtualization on Cloud Workstations
            #     VMs created under this workstation configuration.
            #
            #     Nested virtualization lets you run virtual machine (VM) instances
            #     inside your workstation. Before enabling nested virtualization,
            #     consider the following important considerations. Cloud Workstations
            #     instances are subject to the [same restrictions as Compute Engine
            #     instances](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/nested-virtualization/overview#restrictions):
            #
            #     * **Organization policy**: projects, folders, or
            #     organizations may be restricted from creating nested VMs if the
            #     **Disable VM nested virtualization** constraint is enforced in
            #     the organization policy. For more information, see the
            #     Compute Engine section,
            #     [Checking whether nested virtualization is
            #     allowed](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/nested-virtualization/managing-constraint#checking_whether_nested_virtualization_is_allowed).
            #     * **Performance**: nested VMs might experience a 10% or greater
            #     decrease in performance for workloads that are CPU-bound and
            #     possibly greater than a 10% decrease for workloads that are
            #     input/output bound.
            #     * **Machine Type**: nested virtualization can only be enabled on
            #     workstation configurations that specify a
            #     {::Google::Cloud::Workstations::V1beta::WorkstationConfig::Host::GceInstance#machine_type machine_type}
            #     in the N1 or N2 machine series.
            #     * **GPUs**: nested virtualization may not be enabled on workstation
            #     configurations with accelerators.
            #     * **Operating System**: Because
            #     [Container-Optimized
            #     OS](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/os-details#container-optimized_os_cos)
