          # ## API Overview
          #
          # The `beyondcorp.googleapis.com` service implements the Google Cloud
          # BeyondCorp API.
          #
          # ## Data Model
          #
          # The AppConnectionsService exposes the following resources:
          #
          # * AppConnections, named as follows:
          #   `projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/appConnections/{app_connection_id}`.
          #
          # The AppConnectionsService service provides methods to manage
          # (create/read/update/delete) BeyondCorp AppConnections.
          #
          # To load this service and instantiate a client:
          #
          #     require "google/cloud/beyond_corp/app_connections/v1/app_connections_service"
          #     client = ::Google::Cloud::BeyondCorp::AppConnections::V1::AppConnectionsService::Client.new
          #
          module AppConnectionsService
