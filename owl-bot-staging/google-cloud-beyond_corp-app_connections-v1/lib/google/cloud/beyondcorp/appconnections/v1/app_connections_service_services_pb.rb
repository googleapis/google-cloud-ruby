            # ## API Overview
            #
            # The `beyondcorp.googleapis.com` service implements the Google Cloud
            # BeyondCorp API.
            #
            # ## Data Model
            #
            # The AppConnectionsService exposes the following resources:
            #
            # * AppConnections, named as follows:
            #   `projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/appConnections/{app_connection_id}`.
            #
            # The AppConnectionsService service provides methods to manage
            # (create/read/update/delete) BeyondCorp AppConnections.
