# Snippet for the register_instance call in the NotebookService service
#
# This is an auto-generated example demonstrating basic usage of
# Google::Cloud::Notebooks::V1::NotebookService::Client#register_instance. It
# may require modification in order to execute successfully.
#
def register_instance
  # Create a client object. The client can be reused for multiple calls.

  # Call the register_instance method.
  result = client.register_instance request

  # The returned object is of type Gapic::Operation. You can use it to
  # check the status of an operation, cancel it, or wait for results.
  # Here is how to wait for a response.
