        # @!attribute [rw] name
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Output only. After you create a job, Data Labeling Service assigns a name
        #     to the job with the following format:
        #
        #     "projects/<var>\\{project_id}</var>/evaluationJobs/<var>\\{evaluation_job_id}</var>"
        # @!attribute [rw] description
        #   @return [::String]

        # @!attribute [rw] schedule
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Required. Describes the interval at which the job runs. This interval must
        #     be at least 1 day, and it is rounded to the nearest day. For example, if
        #     you specify a 50-hour interval, the job runs every 2 days.
        #
        #     You can provide the schedule in
        #     [crontab format](/scheduler/docs/configuring/cron-job-schedules) or in an
        #     [English-like
        #     format](/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/cronref#schedule_format).
        #

        #     Required. Name of the {::Google::Cloud::DataLabeling::V1beta1::AnnotationSpecSet AnnotationSpecSet} describing all the
        #     labels that your machine learning model outputs. You must create this

        #     labels for prediction input. If you want the service to assign human
        #     labelers to annotate your data, set this to `true`. If you want to provide

            # does several things:
            #
            # 1. If you have configured your job to use Data Labeling Service for
            #    ground truth labeling, the service creates a
            #    {::Google::Cloud::DataLabeling::V1beta1::Dataset Dataset} and a labeling task for all data sampled
            #    since the last time the job ran. Human labelers provide ground truth
            #    labels for your data. Human labeling may take hours, or even days,
            #    depending on how much data has been sampled. The job remains in the
            #    `RUNNING` state during this time, and it can even be running multiple
            #    times in parallel if it gets triggered again (for example 24 hours
            #    later) before the earlier run has completed. When human labelers have
            #    finished labeling the data, the next step occurs.
            #    <br><br>
            #    If you have configured your job to provide your own ground truth
            #    labels, Data Labeling Service still creates a {::Google::Cloud::DataLabeling::V1beta1::Dataset Dataset} for newly
            #    sampled data, but it expects that you have already added ground truth
            #    labels to the BigQuery table by this time. The next step occurs
            #    immediately.
            #
            # 2. Data Labeling Service creates an {::Google::Cloud::DataLabeling::V1beta1::Evaluation Evaluation} by comparing your
            #    model version's predictions with the ground truth labels.
            #
            # If the job remains in this state for a long time, it continues to sample
            # prediction data into your BigQuery table and will run again at the next
            # interval, even if it causes the job to run multiple times in parallel.
