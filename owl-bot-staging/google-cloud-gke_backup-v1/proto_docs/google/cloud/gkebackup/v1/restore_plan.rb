        #   @return [::String]
        #     Output only. The full name of the RestorePlan resource.

        # @!attribute [r] uid
        #   @return [::String]

        #     [UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) format.
        # @!attribute [r] create_time
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Timestamp]
        #     Output only. The timestamp when this RestorePlan resource was
        #     created.
        # @!attribute [r] update_time
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Timestamp]
        #     Output only. The timestamp when this RestorePlan resource was last
        #     updated.
        # @!attribute [rw] description
        #   @return [::String]
        #     User specified descriptive string for this RestorePlan.
        # @!attribute [rw] backup_plan
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Required. Immutable. A reference to the
        #     {::Google::Cloud::GkeBackup::V1::BackupPlan BackupPlan} from which Backups may
        #     be used as the source for Restores created via this RestorePlan. Format:
        #     `projects/*/locations/*/backupPlans/*`.
        # @!attribute [rw] cluster
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Required. Immutable. The target cluster into which Restores created via
        #     this RestorePlan will restore data. NOTE: the cluster's region must be the
        #     same as the RestorePlan. Valid formats:
        #
        #       - `projects/*/locations/*/clusters/*`

        # @!attribute [r] etag
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Output only. `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to
        #     help prevent simultaneous updates of a restore from overwriting each other.
        #     It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the
        #     read-modify-write cycle to perform restore updates in order to avoid
        #     race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `GetRestorePlan`,
        #     and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to
        #     `UpdateRestorePlan` or `DeleteRestorePlan` to ensure that their change
        #     will be applied to the same version of the resource.

        #     during the Create operation.
