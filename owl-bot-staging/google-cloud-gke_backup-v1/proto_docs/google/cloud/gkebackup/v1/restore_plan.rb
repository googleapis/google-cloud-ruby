        #     It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the
        #     read-modify-write cycle to perform restore updates in order to avoid
        #     race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `GetRestorePlan`,
        #     and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to
        #     `UpdateRestorePlan` or `DeleteRestorePlan` to ensure that their change
        #     will be applied to the same version of the resource.
