        #     order to avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to
        #     `GetBackupPlanBinding`, and systems are expected to put that etag in
        #     the request to `UpdateBackupPlanBinding` or
        #     `DeleteBackupPlanBinding` to ensure that their change will be applied
        #     to the same version of the resource.
