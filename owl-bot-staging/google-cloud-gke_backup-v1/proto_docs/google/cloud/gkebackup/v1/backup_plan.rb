        #     help prevent simultaneous updates of a backup plan from overwriting each
        #     other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the 'etag' in the
        #     read-modify-write cycle to perform BackupPlan updates in order to avoid
        #     race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `GetBackupPlan`,
        #     and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to
        #     `UpdateBackupPlan` or `DeleteBackupPlan` to ensure that their change
        #     will be applied to the same version of the resource.
