      # Create a new client object for IAMCredentials.
      #
      # By default, this returns an instance of
      # [Google::Iam::Credentials::V1::IAMCredentials::Client](https://cloud.google.com/ruby/docs/reference/google-iam-credentials-v1/latest/Google-Iam-Credentials-V1-IAMCredentials-Client)
      # for a gRPC client for version V1 of the API.
      # However, you can specify a different API version by passing it in the
      # `version` parameter. If the IAMCredentials service is
      # supported by that API version, and the corresponding gem is available, the
      # appropriate versioned client will be returned.
      # You can also specify a different transport by passing `:rest` or `:grpc` in
      # the `transport` parameter.
      #
      # ## About IAMCredentials
      #
      # A service account is a special type of Google account that belongs to your
      # application or a virtual machine (VM), instead of to an individual end user.
      # Your application assumes the identity of the service account to call Google
      # APIs, so that the users aren't directly involved.
      #
      # Service account credentials are used to temporarily assume the identity
      # of the service account. Supported credential types include OAuth 2.0 access
      # tokens, OpenID Connect ID tokens, self-signed JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), and
      # more.
      #
      # @param version [::String, ::Symbol] The API version to connect to. Optional.
      #   Defaults to `:v1`.
      # @param transport [:grpc, :rest] The transport to use. Defaults to `:grpc`.
      # @return [::Object] A client object for the specified version.
