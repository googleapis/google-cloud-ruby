    # `Authentication` defines the authentication configuration for API methods

    # Example:
    #
    #     name: calendar.googleapis.com
    #     authentication:
    #       providers:

    #     If not empty, the header value has to match (case sensitive) this prefix.
    #     If not matched, JWT will not be extracted. If matched, JWT will be
    #     extracted after the prefix is removed.

    #     Example: "bookstore_auth".
    # @!attribute [rw] issuer
    #   @return [::String]
    #     Identifies the principal that issued the JWT. See
    #     https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token-32#section-4.1.1
    #     Usually a URL or an email address.
    #
    #     Example: https://securetoken.google.com
    #     Example: 1234567-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com
    # @!attribute [rw] jwks_uri
    #   @return [::String]
    #     URL of the provider's public key set to validate signature of the JWT. See
    #     [OpenID
    #     Discovery](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderMetadata).
    #     Optional if the key set document:
    #      - can be retrieved from
    #        [OpenID
    #        Discovery](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html)
    #        of the issuer.
    #      - can be inferred from the email domain of the issuer (e.g. a Google

    #     Example: https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs
    # @!attribute [rw] audiences
    #   @return [::String]
    #     The list of JWT
    #     [audiences](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token-32#section-4.1.3).
    #     that are allowed to access. A JWT containing any of these audiences will
    #     be accepted. When this setting is absent, JWTs with audiences:
    #       - "https://[service.name]/[google.protobuf.Api.name]"
    #       - "https://[service.name]/"
    #     will be accepted.
    #     For example, if no audiences are in the setting, LibraryService API will
    #     accept JWTs with the following audiences:
    #       -
    #       https://library-example.googleapis.com/google.example.library.v1.LibraryService
    #       - https://library-example.googleapis.com/

    #                    bookstore_web.apps.googleusercontent.com
    # @!attribute [rw] authorization_url
    #   @return [::String]
    #     Redirect URL if JWT token is required but not present or is expired.
    #     Implement authorizationUrl of securityDefinitions in OpenAPI spec.
    # @!attribute [rw] jwt_locations
    #   @return [::Array<::Google::Api::JwtLocation>]
    #     Defines the locations to extract the JWT.  For now it is only used by the
    #     Cloud Endpoints to store the OpenAPI extension [x-google-jwt-locations]
    #     (https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/openapi/openapi-extensions#x-google-jwt-locations)
    #
    #     JWT locations can be one of HTTP headers, URL query parameters or
    #     cookies. The rule is that the first match wins.
    #
    #     If not specified,  default to use following 3 locations:
    #        1) Authorization: Bearer
    #        2) x-goog-iap-jwt-assertion
    #        3) access_token query parameter
    #
    #     Default locations can be specified as followings:
    #        jwt_locations:
    #        - header: Authorization
    #          value_prefix: "Bearer "
    #        - header: x-goog-iap-jwt-assertion
    #        - query: access_token

    # OAuth scopes are a way to define data and permissions on data. For example,
    # there are scopes defined for "Read-only access to Google Calendar" and
    # "Access to Cloud Platform". Users can consent to a scope for an application,
    # giving it permission to access that data on their behalf.
    #
    # OAuth scope specifications should be fairly coarse grained; a user will need
    # to see and understand the text description of what your scope means.
    #
    # In most cases: use one or at most two OAuth scopes for an entire family of
    # products. If your product has multiple APIs, you should probably be sharing
    # the OAuth scope across all of those APIs.
    #
    # When you need finer grained OAuth consent screens: talk with your product
    # management about how developers will use them in practice.
    #
    # Please note that even though each of the canonical scopes is enough for a
    # request to be accepted and passed to the backend, a request can still fail
    # due to the backend requiring additional scopes or permissions.
    # @!attribute [rw] canonical_scopes
    #   @return [::String]
    #     The list of publicly documented OAuth scopes that are allowed access. An
    #     OAuth token containing any of these scopes will be accepted.

    #
    #          canonical_scopes: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar,
