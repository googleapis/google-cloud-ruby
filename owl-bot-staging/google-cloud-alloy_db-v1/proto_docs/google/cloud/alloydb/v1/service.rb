        # Message for deleting a User
        # @!attribute [rw] name
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Required. The name of the resource. For the required format, see the
        #     comment on the User.name field.
        # @!attribute [rw] request_id
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique
        #     request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to
        #     ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will
        #     guarantee that for at least 60 minutes after the first request.
        #
        #     For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
        #     the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request
        #     ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID
        #     was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents
        #     clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.
        #
        #     The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is
        #     not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
        # @!attribute [rw] validate_only
        #   @return [::Boolean]
        #     Optional. If set, the backend validates the request, but doesn't actually
        #     execute it.
