        # `AccessPolicy` is a container for `AccessLevels` (which define the necessary
        # attributes to use Google Cloud services) and `ServicePerimeters` (which
        # define regions of services able to freely pass data within a perimeter). An
        # access policy is globally visible within an organization, and the
        # restrictions it specifies apply to all projects within an organization.
        # @!attribute [rw] name
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Output only. Resource name of the `AccessPolicy`. Format:
        #     `accessPolicies/{access_policy}`
        # @!attribute [rw] parent
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Required. The parent of this `AccessPolicy` in the Cloud Resource
        #     Hierarchy. Currently immutable once created. Format:
        #     `organizations/{organization_id}`
        # @!attribute [rw] title
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Required. Human readable title. Does not affect behavior.
        # @!attribute [rw] scopes
        #   @return [::Array<::String>]
        #     The scopes of a policy define which resources an ACM policy can restrict,
        #     and where ACM resources can be referenced.
        #     For example, a policy with scopes=["folders/123"] has the following
        #     behavior:
        #     - vpcsc perimeters can only restrict projects within folders/123
        #     - access levels can only be referenced by resources within folders/123.
        #     If empty, there are no limitations on which resources can be restricted by
        #     an ACM policy, and there are no limitations on where ACM resources can be
        #     referenced.
        #     Only one policy can include a given scope (attempting to create a second
        #     policy which includes "folders/123" will result in an error).
        #     Currently, scopes cannot be modified after a policy is created.
        #     Currently, policies can only have a single scope.
        #     Format: list of `folders/{folder_number}` or `projects/{project_number}`
        # @!attribute [rw] create_time
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Timestamp]
        #     Output only. Time the `AccessPolicy` was created in UTC.
        # @!attribute [rw] update_time
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Timestamp]
        #     Output only. Time the `AccessPolicy` was updated in UTC.
        # @!attribute [rw] etag
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Output only. An opaque identifier for the current version of the
        #     `AccessPolicy`. This will always be a strongly validated etag, meaning that
        #     two Access Polices will be identical if and only if their etags are
        #     identical. Clients should not expect this to be in any specific format.
