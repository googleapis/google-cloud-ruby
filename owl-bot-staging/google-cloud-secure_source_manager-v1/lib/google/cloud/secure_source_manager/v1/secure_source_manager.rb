        # Secure Source Manager API
        #
        # Access Secure Source Manager instances, resources, and repositories.
        #
        # This API is split across two servers: the Control Plane and the Data Plane.
        #
        # Data Plane endpoints are hosted directly by your Secure Source Manager
        # instance, so you must connect to your instance's API hostname to access
        # them. The API hostname looks like the following:
        #
        #    https://[instance-id]-[project-number]-api.[location].sourcemanager.dev
        #
        # For example,
        #
        #    https://my-instance-702770452863-api.us-central1.sourcemanager.dev
        #
        # Data Plane endpoints are denoted with **Host: Data Plane**.
        #
        # All other endpoints are found in the normal Cloud API location, namely,
        # `securcesourcemanager.googleapis.com`.
        #
        # @example Load this service and instantiate a gRPC client
        #
        #     require "google/cloud/secure_source_manager/v1/secure_source_manager"
        #     client = ::Google::Cloud::SecureSourceManager::V1::SecureSourceManager::Client.new
        #
        # @example Load this service and instantiate a REST client
        #
        #     require "google/cloud/secure_source_manager/v1/secure_source_manager/rest"
        #     client = ::Google::Cloud::SecureSourceManager::V1::SecureSourceManager::Rest::Client.new
