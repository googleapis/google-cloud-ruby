        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Duration]

        #     other actions (or to provide debugging support tools like SSH servers).
        # @!attribute [rw] always_run
        #   @return [::Boolean]
        #     By default, after an action fails, no further actions are run. This flag
        #     indicates that this action must be run even if the pipeline has already
        #     failed. This is useful for actions that copy output files off of the VM
        #     or for debugging. Note that no actions will be run if image prefetching

        #     not need the `enable_fuse` flag to access the mounted filesystem.
        #
        #     This has the effect of causing the container to be executed with
        #     `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` and exposes `/dev/fuse` to the container, so use it only
        #     for containers you trust.

        #     in the operation metadata.
        # @!attribute [rw] disable_image_prefetch
        #   @return [::Boolean]
        #     All container images are typically downloaded before any actions are
        #     executed. This helps prevent typos in URIs or issues like lack of disk
        #     space from wasting large amounts of compute resources.
