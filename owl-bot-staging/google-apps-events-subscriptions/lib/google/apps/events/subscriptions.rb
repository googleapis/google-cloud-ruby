        # Create a new client object for SubscriptionsService.
        #
        # By default, this returns an instance of
        # [Google::Apps::Events::Subscriptions::V1::SubscriptionsService::Client](https://cloud.google.com/ruby/docs/reference/google-apps-events-subscriptions-v1/latest/Google-Apps-Events-Subscriptions-V1-SubscriptionsService-Client)
        # for a gRPC client for version V1 of the API.
        # However, you can specify a different API version by passing it in the
        # `version` parameter. If the SubscriptionsService service is
        # supported by that API version, and the corresponding gem is available, the
        # appropriate versioned client will be returned.
        # You can also specify a different transport by passing `:rest` or `:grpc` in
        # the `transport` parameter.
        #
        # ## About SubscriptionsService
