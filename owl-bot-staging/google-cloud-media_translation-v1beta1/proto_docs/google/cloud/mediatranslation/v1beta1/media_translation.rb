        # Provides information to the speech translation that specifies how to process
        # the request.
        # @!attribute [rw] audio_encoding
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Required. Encoding of audio data.
        #     Supported formats:
        #
        #     - `linear16`
        #
        #       Uncompressed 16-bit signed little-endian samples (Linear PCM).
        #
        #     - `flac`
        #
        #       `flac` (Free Lossless Audio Codec) is the recommended encoding
        #       because it is lossless--therefore recognition is not compromised--and
        #       requires only about half the bandwidth of `linear16`.
        #
        #     - `mulaw`
        #
        #       8-bit samples that compand 14-bit audio samples using G.711 PCMU/mu-law.
        #
        #     - `amr`
        #
        #       Adaptive Multi-Rate Narrowband codec. `sample_rate_hertz` must be 8000.
        #
        #     - `amr-wb`
        #
        #       Adaptive Multi-Rate Wideband codec. `sample_rate_hertz` must be 16000.
        #
        #     - `ogg-opus`
        #
        #       Opus encoded audio frames in [Ogg](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogg)
        #       container. `sample_rate_hertz` must be one of 8000, 12000, 16000, 24000,
        #       or 48000.
        #
        #     - `mp3`
        #
        #       MP3 audio. Support all standard MP3 bitrates (which range from 32-320
        #       kbps). When using this encoding, `sample_rate_hertz` has to match the
        #       sample rate of the file being used.
        # @!attribute [rw] source_language_code
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Required. Source language code (BCP-47) of the input audio.
        # @!attribute [rw] target_language_code
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Required. Target language code (BCP-47) of the output.
        # @!attribute [rw] sample_rate_hertz
        #   @return [::Integer]
        #     Optional. Sample rate in Hertz of the audio data. Valid values are:
        #     8000-48000. 16000 is optimal. For best results, set the sampling rate of
        #     the audio source to 16000 Hz. If that's not possible, use the native sample
        #     rate of the audio source (instead of re-sampling).
        # @!attribute [rw] model
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Optional. `google-provided-model/video` and
        #     `google-provided-model/enhanced-phone-call` are premium models.
        #     `google-provided-model/phone-call` is not premium model.

        #     the user pauses speaking) until the client closes the input stream (gRPC
