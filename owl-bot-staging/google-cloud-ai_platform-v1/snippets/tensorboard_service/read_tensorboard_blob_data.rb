# Snippet for the read_tensorboard_blob_data call in the TensorboardService service
#
# This is an auto-generated example demonstrating basic usage of
# Google::Cloud::AIPlatform::V1::TensorboardService::Client#read_tensorboard_blob_data.
# It may require modification in order to execute successfully.
#
def read_tensorboard_blob_data
  # Create a client object. The client can be reused for multiple calls.
  client = Google::Cloud::AIPlatform::V1::TensorboardService::Client.new

  # Create a request. To set request fields, pass in keyword arguments.
  request = Google::Cloud::AIPlatform::V1::ReadTensorboardBlobDataRequest.new

  # Call the read_tensorboard_blob_data method to start streaming.
  output = client.read_tensorboard_blob_data request

  # The returned object is a streamed enumerable yielding elements of type
  # ::Google::Cloud::AIPlatform::V1::ReadTensorboardBlobDataResponse
