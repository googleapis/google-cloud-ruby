# Snippet for the streaming_read_feature_values call in the FeaturestoreOnlineServingService service
#
# This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code
# template only. It will require modifications to work:
# - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
# - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service
# client as shown in https://cloud.google.com/ruby/docs/reference.
#
# This is an auto-generated example demonstrating basic usage of
# Google::Cloud::AIPlatform::V1::FeaturestoreOnlineServingService::Client#streaming_read_feature_values.
#
def streaming_read_feature_values
  # Create a client object. The client can be reused for multiple calls.
  client = Google::Cloud::AIPlatform::V1::FeaturestoreOnlineServingService::Client.new

  # Create a request. To set request fields, pass in keyword arguments.
  request = Google::Cloud::AIPlatform::V1::StreamingReadFeatureValuesRequest.new

  # Call the streaming_read_feature_values method to start streaming.
  output = client.streaming_read_feature_values request

  # The returned object is a streamed enumerable yielding elements of type
  # ::Google::Cloud::AIPlatform::V1::ReadFeatureValuesResponse
  output.each do |current_response|
    p current_response
  end
