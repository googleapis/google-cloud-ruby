module Google
  module Type
    # Represents a time interval, encoded as a Timestamp start (inclusive) and a
    # Timestamp end (exclusive).
    #
    # The start must be less than or equal to the end.
    # When the start equals the end, the interval is empty (matches no time).
    # When both start and end are unspecified, the interval matches any time.
    # @!attribute [rw] start_time
    #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Timestamp]
    #     Optional. Inclusive start of the interval.
    #
    #     If specified, a Timestamp matching this interval will have to be the same
    #     or after the start.
    # @!attribute [rw] end_time
    #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Timestamp]
    #     Optional. Exclusive end of the interval.
    #
    #     If specified, a Timestamp matching this interval will have to be before the
    #     end.
