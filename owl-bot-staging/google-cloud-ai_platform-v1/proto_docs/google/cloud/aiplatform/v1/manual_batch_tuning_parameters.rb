        #     given in each batch to a machine replica. Machine type, and size of a
        #     single record should be considered when setting this parameter, higher
        #     value speeds up the batch operation's execution, but too high value will
        #     result in a whole batch not fitting in a machine's memory, and the whole
        #     operation will fail.
        #     The default value is 64.
