        # Used to assign specific AnnotationSpec to a particular area of a DataItem or

        # @!attribute [r] name
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Output only. Resource name of the Annotation.
        # @!attribute [rw] payload_schema_uri
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Required. Google Cloud Storage URI points to a YAML file describing
        #     {::Google::Cloud::AIPlatform::V1::Annotation#payload payload}. The schema is
        #     defined as an [OpenAPI 3.0.2 Schema
        #     Object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.2.md#schemaObject).
        #     The schema files that can be used here are found in
        #     gs://google-cloud-aiplatform/schema/dataset/annotation/, note that the
        #     chosen schema must be consistent with the parent Dataset's
        #     {::Google::Cloud::AIPlatform::V1::Dataset#metadata_schema_uri metadata}.
        # @!attribute [rw] payload
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Value]
        #     Required. The schema of the payload can be found in

        # @!attribute [r] create_time

        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Timestamp]
        #     Output only. Timestamp when this Annotation was last updated.
        # @!attribute [rw] etag
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Optional. Used to perform consistent read-modify-write updates. If not set,

        #   @return [::Google::Cloud::AIPlatform::V1::UserActionReference]
        #     Output only. The source of the Annotation.
        # @!attribute [rw] labels
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Map{::String => ::String}]
        #     Optional. The labels with user-defined metadata to organize your
        #     Annotations.
        #
        #     Label keys and values can be no longer than 64 characters
        #     (Unicode codepoints), can only contain lowercase letters, numeric
        #     characters, underscores and dashes. International characters are allowed.
        #     No more than 64 user labels can be associated with one Annotation(System
        #     labels are excluded).
        #
        #     See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for more information and examples of labels.
        #     System reserved label keys are prefixed with "aiplatform.googleapis.com/"
        #     and are immutable. Following system labels exist for each Annotation:
        #
        #     * "aiplatform.googleapis.com/annotation_set_name":
        #       optional, name of the UI's annotation set this Annotation belongs to.
        #       If not set, the Annotation is not visible in the UI.
        #
        #     * "aiplatform.googleapis.com/payload_schema":
        #       output only, its value is the
