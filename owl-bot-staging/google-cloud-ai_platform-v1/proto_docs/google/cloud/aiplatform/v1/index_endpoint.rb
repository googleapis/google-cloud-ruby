        #
        #     Creating `deployment_groups` with `reserved_ip_ranges` is a recommended
        #     practice when the peered network has multiple peering ranges. This creates

        #     administration. Also, one deployment_group (except 'default') can only be

        #     [d, e] is disallowed.
