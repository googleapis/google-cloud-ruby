        #     Label keys and values cannot be longer than 64 characters
        #     (Unicode codepoints), can only contain lowercase letters, numeric
        #     characters, underscores and dashes. International characters are allowed.
        #     No more than 64 user labels can be associated with one Dataset (System
        #     labels are excluded).
        #
        #     See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for more information and examples of labels.

        #
        #     * `aiplatform.googleapis.com/dataset_metadata_schema`: output only. Its
