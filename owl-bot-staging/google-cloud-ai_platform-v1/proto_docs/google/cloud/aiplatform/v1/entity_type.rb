        # An entity type is a type of object in a system that needs to be modeled and
        # have stored information about. For example, driver is an entity type, and
        # driver0 is an instance of an entity type driver.
        # @!attribute [rw] name
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Immutable. Name of the EntityType.
        #     Format:
        #     `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/featurestores/{featurestore}/entityTypes/{entity_type}`
        #
        #     The last part entity_type is assigned by the client. The entity_type can be
        #     up to 64 characters long and can consist only of ASCII Latin letters A-Z
        #     and a-z and underscore(_), and ASCII digits 0-9 starting with a letter. The
        #     value will be unique given a featurestore.
        # @!attribute [rw] description
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Optional. Description of the EntityType.
        # @!attribute [r] create_time
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Timestamp]
        #     Output only. Timestamp when this EntityType was created.

        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Timestamp]
        #     Output only. Timestamp when this EntityType was most recently updated.
        # @!attribute [rw] labels
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Map{::String => ::String}]
        #     Optional. The labels with user-defined metadata to organize your
        #     EntityTypes.
        #
        #     Label keys and values can be no longer than 64 characters
        #     (Unicode codepoints), can only contain lowercase letters, numeric
        #     characters, underscores and dashes. International characters are allowed.
        #
        #     See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for more information on and examples of labels.

        #     labels are excluded)."
        #     System reserved label keys are prefixed with "aiplatform.googleapis.com/"
        #     and are immutable.
        # @!attribute [rw] etag
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Optional. Used to perform a consistent read-modify-write updates. If not
        #     set, a blind "overwrite" update happens.

        #   @return [::Google::Cloud::AIPlatform::V1::FeaturestoreMonitoringConfig]
        #     Optional. The default monitoring configuration for all Features with value

        #     ({::Google::Cloud::AIPlatform::V1::Feature::ValueType Feature.ValueType}) BOOL,
        #     STRING, DOUBLE or INT64 under this EntityType.

        #     If this is populated with
        #     [FeaturestoreMonitoringConfig.monitoring_interval] specified, snapshot
        #     analysis monitoring is enabled. Otherwise, snapshot analysis monitoring is
        #     disabled.
        # @!attribute [rw] offline_storage_ttl_days
        #   @return [::Integer]
        #     Optional. Config for data retention policy in offline storage.
        #     TTL in days for feature values that will be stored in offline storage.
        #     The Feature Store offline storage periodically removes obsolete feature
        #     values older than `offline_storage_ttl_days` since the feature generation
        #     time. If unset (or explicitly set to 0), default to 4000 days TTL.
