        # Vertex AI Feature Store provides a centralized repository for organizing,
        # storing, and serving ML features. The Featurestore is a top-level container
        # for your features and their values.
        # @!attribute [r] name
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Output only. Name of the Featurestore. Format:
        #     `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/featurestores/{featurestore}`
        # @!attribute [r] create_time
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Timestamp]

        # @!attribute [r] update_time
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Timestamp]
        #     Output only. Timestamp when this Featurestore was last updated.
        # @!attribute [rw] etag
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Optional. Used to perform consistent read-modify-write updates. If not set,
        #     a blind "overwrite" update happens.
        # @!attribute [rw] labels
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Map{::String => ::String}]
        #     Optional. The labels with user-defined metadata to organize your
        #     Featurestore.
        #
        #     Label keys and values can be no longer than 64 characters
        #     (Unicode codepoints), can only contain lowercase letters, numeric
        #     characters, underscores and dashes. International characters are allowed.
        #
        #     See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for more information on and examples of labels.
        #     No more than 64 user labels can be associated with one Featurestore(System
        #     labels are excluded)."

        #     co-exist with the field of `OnlineStoreReplicationConfig`. If both of it
        #     and OnlineStoreReplicationConfig are unset, the feature store will not have

        #     serving storage. The Feature Store online storage periodically removes
        #     obsolete feature values older than `online_storage_ttl_days` since the
        #     feature generation time. Note that `online_storage_ttl_days` should be less
        #     than or equal to `offline_storage_ttl_days` for each EntityType under a

        #     both of the online and offline data storage will be secured by this key.
