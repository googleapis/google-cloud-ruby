        #     Output only. Whether ActAs check is bypassed for service account attached
        #     to the VM. If false, we need ActAs check for the default Compute Engine
        #     Service account. When a Runtime is created, a VM is allocated using Default
        #     Compute Engine Service Account. Any user requesting to use this Runtime
        #     requires Service Account User (ActAs) permission over this SA. If true,
        #     Runtime owner is using EUC and does not require the above permission as VM
        #     no longer use default Compute Engine SA, but a P4SA.
