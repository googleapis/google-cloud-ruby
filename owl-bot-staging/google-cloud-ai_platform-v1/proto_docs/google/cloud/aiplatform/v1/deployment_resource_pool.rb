        #     Immutable. The resource name of the DeploymentResourcePool.

        #     Customer-managed encryption key spec for a DeploymentResourcePool. If set,
        #     this DeploymentResourcePool will be secured by this key. Endpoints and the
        #     DeploymentResourcePool they deploy in need to have the same EncryptionSpec.

        #   @return [::String]
        #     The service account that the DeploymentResourcePool's container(s) run as.

        #     is not specified, the container(s) run as a service account that doesn't
        #     have access to the resource project.

        #     AutoML Tabular Models, the container(s) of the DeploymentResourcePool will
        #     send `stderr` and `stdout` streams to Cloud Logging by default.
        #     Please note that the logs incur cost, which are subject to [Cloud Logging
        #     pricing](https://cloud.google.com/logging/pricing).
        #
