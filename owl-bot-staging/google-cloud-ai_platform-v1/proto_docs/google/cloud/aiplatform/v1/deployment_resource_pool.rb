        #     Immutable. The resource name of the DeploymentResourcePool.
        #     Format:

        #     Required. The underlying DedicatedResources that the DeploymentResourcePool
        #     uses.

        #   @return [::Google::Cloud::AIPlatform::V1::EncryptionSpec]
        #     Customer-managed encryption key spec for a DeploymentResourcePool. If set,
        #     this DeploymentResourcePool will be secured by this key. Endpoints and the
        #     DeploymentResourcePool they deploy in need to have the same EncryptionSpec.

        #   @return [::String]
        #     The service account that the DeploymentResourcePool's container(s) run as.
        #     Specify the email address of the service account. If this service account
        #     is not specified, the container(s) run as a service account that doesn't
        #     have access to the resource project.
        #
        #     Users deploying the Models to this DeploymentResourcePool must have the

        #     If the DeploymentResourcePool is deployed with custom-trained Models or
        #     AutoML Tabular Models, the container(s) of the DeploymentResourcePool will
        #     send `stderr` and `stdout` streams to Cloud Logging by default.
        #     Please note that the logs incur cost, which are subject to [Cloud Logging
        #     pricing](https://cloud.google.com/logging/pricing).
        #
        #     User can disable container logging by setting this flag to true.
