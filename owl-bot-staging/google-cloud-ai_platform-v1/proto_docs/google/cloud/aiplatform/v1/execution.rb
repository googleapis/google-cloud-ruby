        #   @return [::Google::Cloud::AIPlatform::V1::Execution::State]
        #     The state of this Execution. This is a property of the Execution, and does
        #     not imply or capture any ongoing process. This property is managed by
        #     clients (such as Vertex AI Pipelines) and the system does not prescribe
        #     or check the validity of state transitions.
        # @!attribute [rw] etag
        #   @return [::String]
        #     An eTag used to perform consistent read-modify-write updates. If not set, a
        #     blind "overwrite" update happens.

        #     (Unicode codepoints), can only contain lowercase letters, numeric
        #     characters, underscores and dashes. International characters are allowed.

        #     The title of the schema describing the metadata.
        #
        #     Schema title and version is expected to be registered in earlier Create
        #     Schema calls. And both are used together as unique identifiers to identify
        #     schemas within the local metadata store.
