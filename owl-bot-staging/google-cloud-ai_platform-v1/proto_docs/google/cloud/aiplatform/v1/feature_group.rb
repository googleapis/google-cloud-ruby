        #     Indicates that features for this group come from BigQuery Table/View.
        #     By default treats the source as a sparse time series source. The BigQuery
        #     source table or view must have at least one entity ID column and a column

        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Map{::String => ::String}]

        #     characters, underscores and dashes. International characters are allowed.
