        # Represents an environment variable present in a Container or Python Module.
        # @!attribute [rw] name
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Required. Name of the environment variable. Must be a valid C identifier.
        # @!attribute [rw] value
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Required. Variables that reference a $(VAR_NAME) are expanded
        #     using the previous defined environment variables in the container and
        #     any service environment variables. If a variable cannot be resolved,
        #     the reference in the input string will be unchanged. The $(VAR_NAME)
        #     syntax can be escaped with a double $$, ie: $$(VAR_NAME). Escaped
        #     references will never be expanded, regardless of whether the variable
        #     exists or not.
