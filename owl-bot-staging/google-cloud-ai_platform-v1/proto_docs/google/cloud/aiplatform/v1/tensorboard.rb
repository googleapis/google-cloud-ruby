        # Tensorboard is a physical database that stores users' training metrics.
        # A default Tensorboard is provided in each region of a GCP project.
        # If needed users can also create extra Tensorboards in their projects.
        # @!attribute [r] name
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Output only. Name of the Tensorboard.

        # @!attribute [rw] display_name
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Required. User provided name of this Tensorboard.

        #   @return [::Google::Cloud::AIPlatform::V1::EncryptionSpec]
        #     Customer-managed encryption key spec for a Tensorboard. If set, this
        #     Tensorboard and all sub-resources of this Tensorboard will be secured by
        #     this key.
        # @!attribute [r] blob_storage_path_prefix
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Output only. Consumer project Cloud Storage path prefix used to store blob data, which
        #     can either be a bucket or directory. Does not end with a '/'.
        # @!attribute [r] run_count
        #   @return [::Integer]

        #     (System labels are excluded).
        #
        #     See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for more information and examples of labels.
