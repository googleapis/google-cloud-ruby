        # A collection of metrics calculated by comparing Model's predictions on all of
        # the test data against annotations from the test data.
        # @!attribute [r] name
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Output only. The resource name of the ModelEvaluation.
        # @!attribute [r] metrics_schema_uri
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Output only. Points to a YAML file stored on Google Cloud Storage describing the
        #     {::Google::Cloud::AIPlatform::V1::ModelEvaluation#metrics metrics} of this ModelEvaluation. The schema is
        #     defined as an OpenAPI 3.0.2 [Schema
        #     Object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.2.md#schemaObject).
        # @!attribute [r] metrics
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Value]
        #     Output only. Evaluation metrics of the Model. The schema of the metrics is stored in

        # @!attribute [r] create_time

        #   @return [::Array<::String>]
        #     Output only. All possible [dimensions][ModelEvaluationSlice.slice.dimension] of
        #     ModelEvaluationSlices. The dimensions can be used as the filter of the
        #     {::Google::Cloud::AIPlatform::V1::ModelService::Client#list_model_evaluation_slices ModelService.ListModelEvaluationSlices} request, in the form of
        #     `slice.dimension = <dimension>`.

        #     data this ModelEvaluation uses. This field is populated only if the Model
        #     is evaluated with explanations, and only for AutoML tabular Models.
