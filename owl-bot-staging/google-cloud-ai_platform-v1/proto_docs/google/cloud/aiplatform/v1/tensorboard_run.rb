        #     Output only. Name of the TensorboardRun.

        # @!attribute [rw] display_name
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Required. User provided name of this TensorboardRun.
        #     This value must be unique among all TensorboardRuns
        #     belonging to the same parent TensorboardExperiment.
        # @!attribute [rw] description
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Description of this TensorboardRun.
        # @!attribute [r] create_time
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Timestamp]
        #     Output only. Timestamp when this TensorboardRun was created.
        # @!attribute [r] update_time
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Timestamp]
        #     Output only. Timestamp when this TensorboardRun was last updated.

        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Map{::String => ::String}]
        #     The labels with user-defined metadata to organize your TensorboardRuns.
        #
        #     This field will be used to filter and visualize Runs in the Tensorboard UI.
        #     For example, a Vertex AI training job can set a label
        #     aiplatform.googleapis.com/training_job_id=xxxxx to all the runs created
        #     within that job. An end user can set a label experiment_id=xxxxx for all
        #     the runs produced in a Jupyter notebook. These runs can be grouped by a
        #     label value and visualized together in the Tensorboard UI.
        #
        #     Label keys and values can be no longer than 64 characters
        #     (Unicode codepoints), can only contain lowercase letters, numeric
        #     characters, underscores and dashes. International characters are allowed.
        #     No more than 64 user labels can be associated with one TensorboardRun
        #     (System labels are excluded).
        #
        #     See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for more information and examples of labels.
        #     System reserved label keys are prefixed with "aiplatform.googleapis.com/"
        #     and are immutable.

        #     "overwrite" update happens.
