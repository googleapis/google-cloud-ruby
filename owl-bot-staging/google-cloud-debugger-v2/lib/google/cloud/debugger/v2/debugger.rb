        # The Debugger service provides the API that allows users to collect run-time
        # information from a running application, without stopping or slowing it down
        # and without modifying its state.  An application may include one or
        # more replicated processes performing the same work.
        #
        # A debugged application is represented using the Debuggee concept. The
        # Debugger service provides a way to query for available debuggees, but does
        # not provide a way to create one.  A debuggee is created using the Controller
        # service, usually by running a debugger agent with the application.
        #
        # The Debugger service enables the client to set one or more Breakpoints on a
        # Debuggee and collect the results of the set Breakpoints.
        #
        # To load this service and instantiate a client:
        #
        #     require "google/cloud/debugger/v2/debugger"
        #     client = ::Google::Cloud::Debugger::V2::Debugger::Client.new
        #
        module Debugger
        end
