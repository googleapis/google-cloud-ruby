      # Create a new client object for GkeHub.
      #
      # By default, this returns an instance of
      # [Google::Cloud::GkeHub::V1::GkeHub::Client](https://cloud.google.com/ruby/docs/reference/google-cloud-gke_hub-v1/latest/Google-Cloud-GkeHub-V1-GkeHub-Client)
      # for a gRPC client for version V1 of the API.
      # However, you can specify a different API version by passing it in the
      # `version` parameter. If the GkeHub service is
      # supported by that API version, and the corresponding gem is available, the
      # appropriate versioned client will be returned.
      # You can also specify a different transport by passing `:rest` or `:grpc` in
      # the `transport` parameter.
      #
      # ## About GkeHub
      #
      # The GKE Hub service handles the registration of many Kubernetes clusters to
      # Google Cloud, and the management of multi-cluster features over those
      # clusters.
      #
      # The GKE Hub service operates on the following resources:
      #
      # * Membership
      # * Feature
      #
      # GKE Hub is currently available in the global region and all regions in
      # https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones. Feature is only
      # available in global region while membership is global region and all the
      # regions.
      #
      # **Membership management may be non-trivial:** it is recommended to use one
      # of the Google-provided client libraries or tools where possible when working
      # with Membership resources.
      #
      # @param version [::String, ::Symbol] The API version to connect to. Optional.
      #   Defaults to `:v1`.
      # @param transport [:grpc, :rest] The transport to use. Defaults to `:grpc`.
      # @return [::Object] A client object for the specified version.
