        # This API resource represents the OS policies compliance data for a Compute
        # Engine virtual machine (VM) instance at a given point in time.
        #
        # A Compute Engine VM can have multiple OS policy assignments, and each
        # assignment can have multiple OS policies. As a result, multiple OS policies
        # could be applied to a single VM.
        #
        # You can use this API resource to determine both the compliance state of your
        # VM as well as the compliance state of an individual OS policy.
        #
