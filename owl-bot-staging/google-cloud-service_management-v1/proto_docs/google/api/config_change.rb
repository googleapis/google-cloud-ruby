module Google

    # Output generated from semantically comparing two versions of a service
    # configuration.
    #
    # Includes detailed information about a field that have changed with
    # applicable advice about potential consequences for the change, such as
    # backwards-incompatibility.
    # @!attribute [rw] element
    #   @return [::String]
    #     Object hierarchy path to the change, with levels separated by a '.'
    #     character. For repeated fields, an applicable unique identifier field is
    #     used for the index (usually selector, name, or id). For maps, the term
    #     'key' is used. If the field has no unique identifier, the numeric index
    #     is used.
    #     Examples:
    #     - visibility.rules[selector=="google.LibraryService.ListBooks"].restriction
    #     - quota.metric_rules[selector=="google"].metric_costs[key=="reads"].value
    #     - logging.producer_destinations[0]
    # @!attribute [rw] old_value
    #   @return [::String]
    #     Value of the changed object in the old Service configuration,
    #     in JSON format. This field will not be populated if ChangeType == ADDED.
    # @!attribute [rw] new_value
    #   @return [::String]
    #     Value of the changed object in the new Service configuration,
    #     in JSON format. This field will not be populated if ChangeType == REMOVED.
    # @!attribute [rw] change_type
    #   @return [::Google::Api::ChangeType]
    #     The type for this change, either ADDED, REMOVED, or MODIFIED.
    # @!attribute [rw] advices
    #   @return [::Array<::Google::Api::Advice>]
    #     Collection of advice provided for this change, useful for determining the
    #     possible impact of this change.
