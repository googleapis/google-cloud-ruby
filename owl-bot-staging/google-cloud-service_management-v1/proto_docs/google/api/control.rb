    # Selects and configures the service controller used by the service.
    #
    # Example:
    #
    #     control:
    #       environment: servicecontrol.googleapis.com
    # @!attribute [rw] environment
    #   @return [::String]
    #     The service controller environment to use. If empty, no control plane
    #     feature (like quota and billing) will be enabled. The recommended value for
    #     most services is servicecontrol.googleapis.com
    # @!attribute [rw] method_policies
    #   @return [::Array<::Google::Api::MethodPolicy>]
    #     Defines policies applying to the API methods of the service.
