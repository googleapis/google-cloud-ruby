    # A backend rule provides configuration for an individual API element.
    # @!attribute [rw] selector
    #   @return [::String]
    #     Selects the methods to which this rule applies.
    #
    #     Refer to {::Google::Api::DocumentationRule#selector selector} for syntax
    #     details.
    # @!attribute [rw] address
    #   @return [::String]
    #     The address of the API backend.
    #
    #     The scheme is used to determine the backend protocol and security.
    #     The following schemes are accepted:
    #
    #        SCHEME        PROTOCOL    SECURITY
    #        http://       HTTP        None
    #        https://      HTTP        TLS
    #        grpc://       gRPC        None
    #        grpcs://      gRPC        TLS
    #
    #     It is recommended to explicitly include a scheme. Leaving out the scheme
    #     may cause constrasting behaviors across platforms.
    #
    #     If the port is unspecified, the default is:
    #     - 80 for schemes without TLS
    #     - 443 for schemes with TLS
    #
    #     For HTTP backends, use {::Google::Api::BackendRule#protocol protocol}
    #     to specify the protocol version.
    # @!attribute [rw] deadline
    #   @return [::Float]
    #     The number of seconds to wait for a response from a request. The default
    #     varies based on the request protocol and deployment environment.
    # @!attribute [rw] min_deadline
    #   @deprecated This field is deprecated and may be removed in the next major version update.
    #   @return [::Float]
    #     Deprecated, do not use.
    # @!attribute [rw] operation_deadline
    #   @return [::Float]
    #     The number of seconds to wait for the completion of a long running
    #     operation. The default is no deadline.
    # @!attribute [rw] path_translation
    #   @return [::Google::Api::BackendRule::PathTranslation]
    # @!attribute [rw] jwt_audience
    #   @return [::String]
    #     The JWT audience is used when generating a JWT ID token for the backend.
    #     This ID token will be added in the HTTP "authorization" header, and sent
    #     to the backend.
    # @!attribute [rw] disable_auth
    #   @return [::Boolean]
    #     When disable_auth is true, a JWT ID token won't be generated and the
    #     original "Authorization" HTTP header will be preserved. If the header is
    #     used to carry the original token and is expected by the backend, this
    #     field must be set to true to preserve the header.
    # @!attribute [rw] protocol
    #   @return [::String]
    #     The protocol used for sending a request to the backend.
    #     The supported values are "http/1.1" and "h2".
    #
    #     The default value is inferred from the scheme in the
    #     {::Google::Api::BackendRule#address address} field:
    #
    #        SCHEME        PROTOCOL
    #        http://       http/1.1
    #        https://      http/1.1
    #        grpc://       h2
    #        grpcs://      h2
    #
    #     For secure HTTP backends (https://) that support HTTP/2, set this field
    #     to "h2" for improved performance.
    #
    #     Configuring this field to non-default values is only supported for secure
    #     HTTP backends. This field will be ignored for all other backends.
    #
    #     See
    #     https://www.iana.org/assignments/tls-extensiontype-values/tls-extensiontype-values.xhtml#alpn-protocol-ids
    #     for more details on the supported values.
    # @!attribute [rw] overrides_by_request_protocol
    #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Map{::String => ::Google::Api::BackendRule}]
    #     The map between request protocol and the backend address.

      # request.
