    # Billing related configuration of the service.
    #
    # The following example shows how to configure monitored resources and metrics
    # for billing, `consumer_destinations` is the only supported destination and
    # the monitored resources need at least one label key
    # `cloud.googleapis.com/location` to indicate the location of the billing
    # usage, using different monitored resources between monitoring and billing is
    # recommended so they can be evolved independently:
    #
    #
    #     monitored_resources:
    #     - type: library.googleapis.com/billing_branch
    #       labels:
    #       - key: cloud.googleapis.com/location
    #         description: |
    #           Predefined label to support billing location restriction.
    #       - key: city
    #         description: |
    #           Custom label to define the city where the library branch is located
    #           in.
    #       - key: name
    #         description: Custom label to define the name of the library branch.
    #     metrics:
    #     - name: library.googleapis.com/book/borrowed_count
    #       metric_kind: DELTA
    #       value_type: INT64
    #       unit: "1"

    #     one consumer destination.
