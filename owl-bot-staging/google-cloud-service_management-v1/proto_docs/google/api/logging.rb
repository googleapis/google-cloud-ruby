    # producer and consumer projects. In the example, the `activity_history`
    # log is sent to both the producer and consumer projects, whereas the
    # `purchase_history` log is only sent to the producer project.

    #         description: The city where the library branch is located in.
    #       - key: /name
    #         description: The name of the branch.
