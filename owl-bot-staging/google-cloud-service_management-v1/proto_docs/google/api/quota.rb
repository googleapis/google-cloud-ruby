    # Quota configuration helps to achieve fairness and budgeting in service
    # usage.
    #
    # The metric based quota configuration works this way:
    # - The service configuration defines a set of metrics.
    # - For API calls, the quota.metric_rules maps methods to metrics with
    #   corresponding costs.
    # - The quota.limits defines limits on the metrics, which will be used for
    #   quota checks at runtime.
    #
    # An example quota configuration in yaml format:
    #
    #    quota:
    #      limits:
    #
    #      - name: apiWriteQpsPerProject
    #        metric: library.googleapis.com/write_calls
    #        unit: "1/min/\\{project}"  # rate limit for consumer projects
    #        values:
    #          STANDARD: 10000
    #
    #
    #      (The metric rules bind all methods to the read_calls metric,
    #       except for the UpdateBook and DeleteBook methods. These two methods
    #       are mapped to the write_calls metric, with the UpdateBook method
    #       consuming at twice rate as the DeleteBook method.)
    #      metric_rules:
    #      - selector: "*"
    #        metric_costs:
    #          library.googleapis.com/read_calls: 1
    #      - selector: google.example.library.v1.LibraryService.UpdateBook
    #        metric_costs:
    #          library.googleapis.com/write_calls: 2
    #      - selector: google.example.library.v1.LibraryService.DeleteBook
    #        metric_costs:
    #          library.googleapis.com/write_calls: 1

    # `QuotaLimit` defines a specific limit that applies over a specified duration
    # for a limit type. There can be at most one limit for a duration and limit
    # type combination defined within a `QuotaGroup`.
    # @!attribute [rw] name
    #   @return [::String]
    #     Name of the quota limit.
    #
    #     The name must be provided, and it must be unique within the service. The
    #     name can only include alphanumeric characters as well as '-'.
    #
    #     The maximum length of the limit name is 64 characters.
    # @!attribute [rw] description
    #   @return [::String]
    #     Optional. User-visible, extended description for this quota limit.
    #     Should be used only when more context is needed to understand this limit
    #     than provided by the limit's display name (see: `display_name`).
    # @!attribute [rw] default_limit
    #   @return [::Integer]
    #     Default number of tokens that can be consumed during the specified
    #     duration. This is the number of tokens assigned when a client
    #     application developer activates the service for his/her project.
    #
    #     Specifying a value of 0 will block all requests. This can be used if you
    #     are provisioning quota to selected consumers and blocking others.
    #     Similarly, a value of -1 will indicate an unlimited quota. No other
    #     negative values are allowed.
    #
    #     Used by group-based quotas only.
    # @!attribute [rw] max_limit
    #   @return [::Integer]
    #     Maximum number of tokens that can be consumed during the specified
    #     duration. Client application developers can override the default limit up
    #     to this maximum. If specified, this value cannot be set to a value less
    #     than the default limit. If not specified, it is set to the default limit.
    #
    #     To allow clients to apply overrides with no upper bound, set this to -1,
    #     indicating unlimited maximum quota.
    #
    #     Used by group-based quotas only.
    # @!attribute [rw] free_tier
    #   @return [::Integer]
    #     Free tier value displayed in the Developers Console for this limit.
    #     The free tier is the number of tokens that will be subtracted from the
    #     billed amount when billing is enabled.
    #     This field can only be set on a limit with duration "1d", in a billable
    #     group; it is invalid on any other limit. If this field is not set, it
    #     defaults to 0, indicating that there is no free tier for this service.
    #
    #     Used by group-based quotas only.
    # @!attribute [rw] duration
    #   @return [::String]
    #     Duration of this limit in textual notation. Must be "100s" or "1d".
    #
    #     Used by group-based quotas only.
    # @!attribute [rw] metric
    #   @return [::String]
    #     The name of the metric this quota limit applies to. The quota limits with
    #     the same metric will be checked together during runtime. The metric must be
    #     defined within the service config.
    # @!attribute [rw] unit
    #   @return [::String]
    #     Specify the unit of the quota limit. It uses the same syntax as
    #     [Metric.unit][]. The supported unit kinds are determined by the quota
    #     backend system.
    #
    #     Here are some examples:
    #     * "1/min/\\{project}" for quota per minute per project.
    #
    #     Note: the order of unit components is insignificant.
    #     The "1" at the beginning is required to follow the metric unit syntax.
    # @!attribute [rw] values
    #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Map{::String => ::Integer}]
    #     Tiered limit values. You must specify this as a key:value pair, with an
    #     integer value that is the maximum number of requests allowed for the
    #     specified unit. Currently only STANDARD is supported.
    # @!attribute [rw] display_name
    #   @return [::String]
    #     User-visible display name for this limit.
    #     Optional. If not set, the UI will provide a default display name based on
    #     the quota configuration. This field can be used to override the default
    #     display name generated from the configuration.
