  module Api
    # `Context` defines which contexts an API requests.
    #
    # Example:
    #
    #     context:
    #       rules:
    #       - selector: "*"
    #         requested:
    #         - google.rpc.context.ProjectContext
    #         - google.rpc.context.OriginContext
    #
    # The above specifies that all methods in the API request
    # `google.rpc.context.ProjectContext` and
    # `google.rpc.context.OriginContext`.
    #
    # Available context types are defined in package
    # `google.rpc.context`.
    #
    # This also provides mechanism to allowlist any protobuf message extension that
    # can be sent in grpc metadata using “x-goog-ext-<extension_id>-bin” and
    # “x-goog-ext-<extension_id>-jspb” format. For example, list any service
    # specific protobuf types that can appear in grpc metadata as follows in your
    # yaml file:
    #
    # Example:
    #
    #     context:
    #       rules:
    #        - selector: "google.example.library.v1.LibraryService.CreateBook"
    #          allowed_request_extensions:
    #          - google.foo.v1.NewExtension
    #          allowed_response_extensions:
    #          - google.foo.v1.NewExtension
    #
    # You can also specify extension ID instead of fully qualified extension name
    # here.
    # @!attribute [rw] rules
    #   @return [::Array<::Google::Api::ContextRule>]
    #     A list of RPC context rules that apply to individual API methods.
    #
    #     **NOTE:** All service configuration rules follow "last one wins" order.
