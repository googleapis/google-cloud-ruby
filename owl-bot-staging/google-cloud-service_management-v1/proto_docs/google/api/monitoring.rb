    # Monitoring configuration of the service.
    #
    # The example below shows how to configure monitored resources and metrics
    # for monitoring. In the example, a monitored resource and two metrics are
    # defined. The `library.googleapis.com/book/returned_count` metric is sent
    # to both producer and consumer projects, whereas the
    # `library.googleapis.com/book/num_overdue` metric is only sent to the
    # consumer project.
    #
    #     monitored_resources:
    #     - type: library.googleapis.com/Branch
    #       display_name: "Library Branch"
