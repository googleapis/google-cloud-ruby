  module Api
    # `Service` is the root object of Google service configuration schema. It
    # describes basic information about a service, such as the name and the
    # title, and delegates other aspects to sub-sections. Each sub-section is
    # either a proto message or a repeated proto message that configures a
    # specific aspect, such as auth. See each proto message definition for details.
    #
    # Example:
    #
    #     type: google.api.Service
    #     name: calendar.googleapis.com
    #     title: Google Calendar API
    #     apis:
    #     - name: google.calendar.v3.Calendar
    #     authentication:
    #       providers:
    #       - id: google_calendar_auth
    #         jwks_uri: https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs
    #         issuer: https://securetoken.google.com
    #       rules:
    #       - selector: "*"
    #         requirements:
    #           provider_id: google_calendar_auth
    # @!attribute [rw] name
    #   @return [::String]
    #     The service name, which is a DNS-like logical identifier for the
    #     service, such as `calendar.googleapis.com`. The service name
    #     typically goes through DNS verification to make sure the owner
    #     of the service also owns the DNS name.
    # @!attribute [rw] title
    #   @return [::String]
    #     The product title for this service.
    # @!attribute [rw] producer_project_id
    #   @return [::String]
    #     The Google project that owns this service.
    # @!attribute [rw] id
    #   @return [::String]
    #     A unique ID for a specific instance of this message, typically assigned
    #     by the client for tracking purpose. Must be no longer than 63 characters
    #     and only lower case letters, digits, '.', '_' and '-' are allowed. If
    #     empty, the server may choose to generate one instead.
    # @!attribute [rw] apis
    #   @return [::Array<::Google::Protobuf::Api>]
    #     A list of API interfaces exported by this service. Only the `name` field
    #     of the {::Google::Protobuf::Api google.protobuf.Api} needs to be provided by the configuration
    #     author, as the remaining fields will be derived from the IDL during the
    #     normalization process. It is an error to specify an API interface here
    #     which cannot be resolved against the associated IDL files.
    # @!attribute [rw] types
    #   @return [::Array<::Google::Protobuf::Type>]
    #     A list of all proto message types included in this API service.
    #     Types referenced directly or indirectly by the `apis` are
    #     automatically included.  Messages which are not referenced but
    #     shall be included, such as types used by the `google.protobuf.Any` type,
    #     should be listed here by name. Example:
    #
    #         types:
    #         - name: google.protobuf.Int32
    # @!attribute [rw] enums
    #   @return [::Array<::Google::Protobuf::Enum>]
    #     A list of all enum types included in this API service.  Enums
    #     referenced directly or indirectly by the `apis` are automatically
    #     included.  Enums which are not referenced but shall be included
    #     should be listed here by name. Example:
    #
    #         enums:
    #         - name: google.someapi.v1.SomeEnum
    # @!attribute [rw] documentation
    #   @return [::Google::Api::Documentation]
    #     Additional API documentation.
    # @!attribute [rw] backend
    #   @return [::Google::Api::Backend]
    #     API backend configuration.
    # @!attribute [rw] http
    #   @return [::Google::Api::Http]
    #     HTTP configuration.
    # @!attribute [rw] quota
    #   @return [::Google::Api::Quota]
    #     Quota configuration.
    # @!attribute [rw] authentication
    #   @return [::Google::Api::Authentication]
    #     Auth configuration.
    # @!attribute [rw] context
    #   @return [::Google::Api::Context]
    #     Context configuration.
    # @!attribute [rw] usage
    #   @return [::Google::Api::Usage]
    #     Configuration controlling usage of this service.
    # @!attribute [rw] endpoints
    #   @return [::Array<::Google::Api::Endpoint>]
    #     Configuration for network endpoints.  If this is empty, then an endpoint
    #     with the same name as the service is automatically generated to service all
    #     defined APIs.
    # @!attribute [rw] control
    #   @return [::Google::Api::Control]
    #     Configuration for the service control plane.
    # @!attribute [rw] logs
    #   @return [::Array<::Google::Api::LogDescriptor>]
    #     Defines the logs used by this service.
    # @!attribute [rw] metrics
    #   @return [::Array<::Google::Api::MetricDescriptor>]
    #     Defines the metrics used by this service.
    # @!attribute [rw] monitored_resources
    #   @return [::Array<::Google::Api::MonitoredResourceDescriptor>]
    #     Defines the monitored resources used by this service. This is required
    #     by the {::Google::Api::Service#monitoring Service.monitoring} and {::Google::Api::Service#logging Service.logging} configurations.
    # @!attribute [rw] billing
    #   @return [::Google::Api::Billing]
    #     Billing configuration.
    # @!attribute [rw] logging
    #   @return [::Google::Api::Logging]
    #     Logging configuration.
    # @!attribute [rw] monitoring
    #   @return [::Google::Api::Monitoring]

    #     System parameter configuration.
    # @!attribute [rw] source_info
    #   @return [::Google::Api::SourceInfo]
    #     Output only. The source information for this configuration if available.
    # @!attribute [rw] config_version
    #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::UInt32Value]
    #     Obsolete. Do not use.
    #
    #     This field has no semantic meaning. The service config compiler always
    #     sets this field to `3`.
