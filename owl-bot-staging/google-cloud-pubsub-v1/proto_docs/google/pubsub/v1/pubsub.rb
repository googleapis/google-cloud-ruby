        #     subscriber is successfully consuming messages from the subscription or is
        #     issuing operations on the subscription. If `expiration_policy` is not set,

        #     this subscription.
        #
        #     If not set, the default retry policy is applied. This generally implies

        #     exceeded events for a given message.
        # @!attribute [rw] detached
        #   @return [::Boolean]
        #     Optional. Indicates whether the subscription is detached from its topic.
        #     Detached subscriptions don't receive messages from their topic and don't
        #     retain any backlog. `Pull` and `StreamingPull` requests will return
        #     FAILED_PRECONDITION. If the subscription is a push subscription, pushes to
        #     the endpoint will not be made.
        # @!attribute [rw] enable_exactly_once_delivery
        #   @return [::Boolean]
        #     Optional. If true, Pub/Sub provides the following guarantees for the
        #     delivery of a message with a given value of `message_id` on this
        #     subscription:
        #
        #     * The message sent to a subscriber is guaranteed not to be resent
        #     before the message's acknowledgement deadline expires.
        #     * An acknowledged message will not be resent to a subscriber.
        #
        #     Note that subscribers may still receive multiple copies of a message
        #     when `enable_exactly_once_delivery` is true if the message was published
        #     multiple times by a publisher client. These copies are  considered distinct
        #     by Pub/Sub and have distinct `message_id` values.
