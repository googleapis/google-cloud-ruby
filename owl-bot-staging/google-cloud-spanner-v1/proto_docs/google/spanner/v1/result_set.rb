        # @!attribute [rw] values
        #   @return [::Array<::Google::Protobuf::Value>]
        #     A streamed result set consists of a stream of values, which might
        #     be split into many `PartialResultSet` messages to accommodate
        #     large rows and/or large values. Every N complete values defines a
        #     row, where N is equal to the number of entries in
        #     {::Google::Cloud::Spanner::V1::StructType#fields metadata.row_type.fields}.
        #
        #     Most values are encoded based on type as described
        #     {::Google::Cloud::Spanner::V1::TypeCode here}.
        #
        #     It is possible that the last value in values is "chunked",
        #     meaning that the rest of the value is sent in subsequent
        #     `PartialResultSet`(s). This is denoted by the {::Google::Cloud::Spanner::V1::PartialResultSet#chunked_value chunked_value}
        #     field. Two or more chunked values can be merged to form a
        #     complete value as follows:
        #
        #       * `bool/number/null`: cannot be chunked
        #       * `string`: concatenate the strings
        #       * `list`: concatenate the lists. If the last element in a list is a
        #         `string`, `list`, or `object`, merge it with the first element in
        #         the next list by applying these rules recursively.
        #       * `object`: concatenate the (field name, field value) pairs. If a
        #         field name is duplicated, then apply these rules recursively
        #         to merge the field values.
        #
        #     Some examples of merging:
        #
        #         # Strings are concatenated.
        #         "foo", "bar" => "foobar"
        #
        #         # Lists of non-strings are concatenated.
        #         [2, 3], [4] => [2, 3, 4]
        #
        #         # Lists are concatenated, but the last and first elements are merged
        #         # because they are strings.
        #         ["a", "b"], ["c", "d"] => ["a", "bc", "d"]
        #
        #         # Lists are concatenated, but the last and first elements are merged
        #         # because they are lists. Recursively, the last and first elements
        #         # of the inner lists are merged because they are strings.
        #         ["a", ["b", "c"]], [["d"], "e"] => ["a", ["b", "cd"], "e"]
        #
        #         # Non-overlapping object fields are combined.
        #         {"a": "1"}, {"b": "2"} => {"a": "1", "b": 2"}
        #
        #         # Overlapping object fields are merged.
        #         {"a": "1"}, {"a": "2"} => {"a": "12"}
        #
        #         # Examples of merging objects containing lists of strings.
        #         {"a": ["1"]}, {"a": ["2"]} => {"a": ["12"]}
        #
        #     For a more complete example, suppose a streaming SQL query is
        #     yielding a result set whose rows contain a single string
        #     field. The following `PartialResultSet`s might be yielded:
        #
        #         {
        #           "metadata": { ... }
        #           "values": ["Hello", "W"]
        #           "chunked_value": true
        #           "resume_token": "Af65..."
        #         }
        #         {
        #           "values": ["orl"]
        #           "chunked_value": true
        #           "resume_token": "Bqp2..."
        #         }
        #         {
        #           "values": ["d"]
        #           "resume_token": "Zx1B..."
        #         }
        #
        #     This sequence of `PartialResultSet`s encodes two rows, one
        #     containing the field value `"Hello"`, and a second containing the
        #     field value `"World" = "W" + "orl" + "d"`.
        # @!attribute [rw] chunked_value
        #   @return [::Boolean]
        #     If true, then the final value in {::Google::Cloud::Spanner::V1::PartialResultSet#values values} is chunked, and must
        #     be combined with more values from subsequent `PartialResultSet`s
        #     to obtain a complete field value.
        # @!attribute [rw] resume_token
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Streaming calls might be interrupted for a variety of reasons, such
        #     as TCP connection loss. If this occurs, the stream of results can
        #     be resumed by re-sending the original request and including
        #     `resume_token`. Note that executing any other transaction in the
        #     same session invalidates the token.
