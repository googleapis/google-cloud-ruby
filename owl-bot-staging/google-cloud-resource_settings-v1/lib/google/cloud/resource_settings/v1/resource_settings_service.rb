        # An interface to interact with resource settings and setting values throughout
        # the resource hierarchy.
        #
        # Services may surface a number of settings for users to control how their
        # resources behave. Values of settings applied on a given Cloud resource are
        # evaluated hierarchically and inherited by all descendants of that resource.
        #
        # For all requests, returns a `google.rpc.Status` with
        # `google.rpc.Code.PERMISSION_DENIED` if the IAM check fails or the `parent`
        # resource is not in a Cloud Organization.
        # For all requests, returns a `google.rpc.Status` with
        # `google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT` if the request is malformed.
