        # Parallelstore service.
        #
        # The `parallelstore.googleapis.com` service implements the parallelstore API
        # and defines the following resource model for managing instances:
        # * The service works with a collection of cloud projects, named: `/projects/*`
        # * Each project has a collection of available locations, named: `/locations/*`
        # * Each location has a collection of instances named `/instances/*`.
        # * Parallelstore instances are resources of the form:
        #   `/projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/instances/{instance_id}`
        #
        # Note that location_id must be a Google Cloud `zone`; for example:
        # * `projects/12345/locations/us-central1-c/instances/my-parallelstore-share`
        #
        # To load this service and instantiate a REST client:
        #
        #     require "google/cloud/parallelstore/v1/parallelstore/rest"
        #     client = ::Google::Cloud::Parallelstore::V1::Parallelstore::Rest::Client.new
