# This is an auto-generated example demonstrating basic usage of
# Google::Cloud::Workflows::V1beta::Workflows::Client#update_workflow. It may
# require modification in order to execute successfully.

  # Call the update_workflow method.

  # check the status of an operation, cancel it, or wait for results.
  # Here is how to wait for a response.
