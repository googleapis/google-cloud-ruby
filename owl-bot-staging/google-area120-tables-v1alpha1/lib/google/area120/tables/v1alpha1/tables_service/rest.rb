        # The Tables Service provides an API for reading and updating tables.
        # It defines the following resource model:
        #
        # - The API has a collection of {::Google::Area120::Tables::V1alpha1::Table Table}
        #   resources, named `tables/*`
        #
        # - Each Table has a collection of {::Google::Area120::Tables::V1alpha1::Row Row}
        #   resources, named `tables/*/rows/*`
        #
        # - The API has a collection of
        #   {::Google::Area120::Tables::V1alpha1::Workspace Workspace}
        #   resources, named `workspaces/*`.
        #
        # To load this service and instantiate a REST client:
        #
        #     require "google/area120/tables/v1alpha1/tables_service/rest"
        #     client = ::Google::Area120::Tables::V1alpha1::TablesService::Rest::Client.new
