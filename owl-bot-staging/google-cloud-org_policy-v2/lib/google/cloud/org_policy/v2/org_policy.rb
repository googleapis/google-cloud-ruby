        ##
        # An interface for managing organization policies.
        #
        # The Cloud Org Policy service provides a simple mechanism for organizations to
        # restrict the allowed configurations across their entire Cloud Resource
        # hierarchy.
        #
        # You can use a `policy` to configure restrictions in Cloud resources. For
        # example, you can enforce a `policy` that restricts which Google
        # Cloud Platform APIs can be activated in a certain part of your resource
        # hierarchy, or prevents serial port access to VM instances in a particular
        # folder.
        #
        # `Policies` are inherited down through the resource hierarchy. A `policy`
        # applied to a parent resource automatically applies to all its child resources
        # unless overridden with a `policy` lower in the hierarchy.
        #
        # A `constraint` defines an aspect of a resource's configuration that can be
        # controlled by an organization's policy administrator. `Policies` are a
        # collection of `constraints` that defines their allowable configuration on a
        # particular resource and its child resources.
        #
        # @example Load this service and instantiate a gRPC client
        #
        #     require "google/cloud/org_policy/v2/org_policy"
        #     client = ::Google::Cloud::OrgPolicy::V2::OrgPolicy::Client.new
        #
        # @example Load this service and instantiate a REST client
        #
        #     require "google/cloud/org_policy/v2/org_policy/rest"
        #     client = ::Google::Cloud::OrgPolicy::V2::OrgPolicy::Rest::Client.new
        #
