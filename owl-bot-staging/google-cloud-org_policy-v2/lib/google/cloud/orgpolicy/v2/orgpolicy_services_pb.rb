          # An interface for managing organization policies.
          #
          # The Organization Policy Service provides a simple mechanism for
          # organizations to restrict the allowed configurations across their entire
          # resource hierarchy.
          #
          # You can use a policy to configure restrictions on resources. For
          # example, you can enforce a policy that restricts which Google
          # Cloud APIs can be activated in a certain part of your resource
          # hierarchy, or prevents serial port access to VM instances in a
          # particular folder.
          #
          # Policies are inherited down through the resource hierarchy. A policy
          # applied to a parent resource automatically applies to all its child resources
          # unless overridden with a policy lower in the hierarchy.
          #
          # A constraint defines an aspect of a resource's configuration that can be
          # controlled by an organization's policy administrator. Policies are a
          # collection of constraints that defines their allowable configuration on a
          # particular resource and its child resources.
