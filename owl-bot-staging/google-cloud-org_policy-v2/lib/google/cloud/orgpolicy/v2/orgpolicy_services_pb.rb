          # An interface for managing organization policies.
          #
          # The Cloud Org Policy service provides a simple mechanism for organizations to
          # restrict the allowed configurations across their entire Cloud Resource
          # hierarchy.
          #
          # You can use a `policy` to configure restrictions in Cloud resources. For
          # example, you can enforce a `policy` that restricts which Google
          # Cloud Platform APIs can be activated in a certain part of your resource
          # hierarchy, or prevents serial port access to VM instances in a particular
          # folder.
          #
          # `Policies` are inherited down through the resource hierarchy. A `policy`
          # applied to a parent resource automatically applies to all its child resources
          # unless overridden with a `policy` lower in the hierarchy.
          #
          # A `constraint` defines an aspect of a resource's configuration that can be
          # controlled by an organization's policy administrator. `Policies` are a
          # collection of `constraints` that defines their allowable configuration on a
          # particular resource and its child resources.
