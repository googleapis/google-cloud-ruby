        #     `FREQ=MONTHLY;BYSETPOS=1;BYDAY=SA,SU`
        #
        #     This specifies how frequently the window starts. Eg, if you wanted to have
        #     a 9-5 UTC-4 window every weekday, you'd use something like:
        #     ```
        #     start time = 2019-01-01T09:00:00-0400
        #     end time = 2019-01-01T17:00:00-0400
        #     recurrence = FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR
        #     ```
        #
        #     Windows can span multiple days. Eg, to make the window encompass every
        #     weekend from midnight Saturday till the last minute of Sunday UTC:
        #     ```
        #     start time = 2019-01-05T00:00:00Z
        #     end time = 2019-01-07T23:59:00Z
        #     recurrence = FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=SA
        #     ```
        #
        #     Note the start and end time's specific dates are largely arbitrary except
        #     to specify duration of the window and when it first starts.
