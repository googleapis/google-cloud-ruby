# - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service
# client as shown in https://cloud.google.com/ruby/docs/reference.
#
# This is an auto-generated example demonstrating basic usage of
# Google::Shopping::Merchant::Lfp::V1beta::LfpStoreService::Client#get_lfp_store.
#
def get_lfp_store
  # Create a client object. The client can be reused for multiple calls.
  client = Google::Shopping::Merchant::Lfp::V1beta::LfpStoreService::Client.new

  # Create a request. To set request fields, pass in keyword arguments.
  request = Google::Shopping::Merchant::Lfp::V1beta::GetLfpStoreRequest.new

  # Call the get_lfp_store method.
  result = client.get_lfp_store request

  # The returned object is of type Google::Shopping::Merchant::Lfp::V1beta::LfpStore.
