      # Create a new client object for AnalyticsAdminService.
      #
      # By default, this returns an instance of
      # [Google::Analytics::Admin::V1alpha::AnalyticsAdminService::Client](https://rubydoc.info/gems/google-analytics-admin-v1alpha/Google/Analytics/Admin/V1alpha/AnalyticsAdminService/Client)
      # for a gRPC client for version V1alpha of the API.
      # However, you can specify a different API version by passing it in the
      # `version` parameter. If the AnalyticsAdminService service is
      # supported by that API version, and the corresponding gem is available, the
      # appropriate versioned client will be returned.
      # You can also specify a different transport by passing `:rest` or `:grpc` in
      # the `transport` parameter.
