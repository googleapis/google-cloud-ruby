        # Takes a row as input and produces an alternate view of the row based on
        # specified rules. For example, a RowFilter might trim down a row to include
        # just the cells from columns matching a given regular expression, or might
        # return all the cells of a row but not their values. More complicated filters
        # can be composed out of these components to express requests such as, "within
        # every column of a particular family, give just the two most recent cells
        # which are older than timestamp X."
        #
        # There are two broad categories of RowFilters (true filters and transformers),
        # as well as two ways to compose simple filters into more complex ones
        # (chains and interleaves). They work as follows:
        #
        # * True filters alter the input row by excluding some of its cells wholesale
        # from the output row. An example of a true filter is the `value_regex_filter`,
        # which excludes cells whose values don't match the specified pattern. All
        # regex true filters use RE2 syntax (https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax)
        # in raw byte mode (RE2::Latin1), and are evaluated as full matches. An
        # important point to keep in mind is that `RE2(.)` is equivalent by default to
        # `RE2([^\n])`, meaning that it does not match newlines. When attempting to
        # match an arbitrary byte, you should therefore use the escape sequence `\C`,
        # which may need to be further escaped as `\\C` in your client language.
        #
        # * Transformers alter the input row by changing the values of some of its
        # cells in the output, without excluding them completely. Currently, the only
        # supported transformer is the `strip_value_transformer`, which replaces every
        # cell's value with the empty string.
        #
        # * Chains and interleaves are described in more detail in the
        # RowFilter.Chain and RowFilter.Interleave documentation.
        #
        # The total serialized size of a RowFilter message must not
        # exceed 20480 bytes, and RowFilters may not be nested within each other
        # (in Chains or Interleaves) to a depth of more than 20.

        #   @return [::String]
        #     An opaque token sent by the server to allow query resumption and signal
        #     the client to accumulate `partial_rows` since the last non-empty
        #     `resume_token`. On resumption, the resumed query will return the remaining
        #     rows for this query.
        #
        #     If there is a batch in progress, a non-empty `resume_token`
        #     means that that the batch of `partial_rows` will be complete after merging
        #     the `partial_rows` from this response. The client must only yield
        #     completed batches to the application, and must ensure that any future
        #     retries send the latest token to avoid returning duplicate data.
        #
        #     The server may set 'resume_token' without a 'partial_rows'. If there is a
        #     batch in progress the client should yield it.
        #
        #     The server will also send a sentinel `resume_token` when last batch of
        #     `partial_rows` is sent. If the client retries the ExecuteQueryRequest with
        #     the sentinel `resume_token`, the server will emit it again without any
        #     `partial_rows`, then return OK.
        # @!attribute [rw] estimated_batch_size
        #   @return [::Integer]
        #     Estimated size of a new batch. The server will always set this when
        #     returning the first `partial_rows` of a batch, and will not set it at any
        #     other time.
        #
        #     The client can use this estimate to allocate an initial buffer for the
        #     batched results. This helps minimize the number of allocations required,
        #     though the buffer size may still need to be increased if the estimate is
        #     too low.
