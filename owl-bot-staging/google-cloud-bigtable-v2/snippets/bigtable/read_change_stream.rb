# Snippet for the read_change_stream call in the Bigtable service
#
# This is an auto-generated example demonstrating basic usage of
# Google::Cloud::Bigtable::V2::Bigtable::Client#read_change_stream. It may
# require modification in order to execute successfully.

def read_change_stream
  # Create a client object. The client can be reused for multiple calls.
