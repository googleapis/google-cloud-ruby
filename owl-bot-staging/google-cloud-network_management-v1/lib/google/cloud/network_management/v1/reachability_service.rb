        # The Reachability service in the Google Cloud Network Management API provides
        # services that analyze the reachability within a single Google Virtual Private
        # Cloud (VPC) network, between peered VPC networks, between VPC and on-premises
        # networks, or between VPC networks and internet hosts. A reachability analysis
        # is based on Google Cloud network configurations.
        #
        # You can use the analysis results to verify these configurations and
        # to troubleshoot connectivity issues.
        #
        # To load this service and instantiate a client:
        #
        #     require "google/cloud/network_management/v1/reachability_service"
        #     client = ::Google::Cloud::NetworkManagement::V1::ReachabilityService::Client.new
