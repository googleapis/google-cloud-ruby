        # @!attribute [rw] name
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Required. Unique name of the resource using the form:
        #         `projects/{project_id}/locations/global/connectivityTests/{test}`
        # @!attribute [rw] description
        #   @return [::String]
        #     The user-supplied description of the Connectivity Test.
        #     Maximum of 512 characters.
        # @!attribute [rw] source
        #   @return [::Google::Cloud::NetworkManagement::V1::Endpoint]
        #     Required. Source specification of the Connectivity Test.
        #
        #     You can use a combination of source IP address, virtual machine
        #     (VM) instance, or Compute Engine network to uniquely identify
        #     the source location.
        #
        #     Examples:
        #     If the source IP address is an internal IP address within a Google Cloud
        #     Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network, then you must also specify the VPC
        #     network. Otherwise, specify the VM instance, which already contains its
        #     internal IP address and VPC network information.
        #
        #     If the source of the test is within an on-premises network, then you must
        #     provide the destination VPC network.
        #
        #     If the source endpoint is a Compute Engine VM instance with multiple
        #     network interfaces, the instance itself is not sufficient to identify the
        #     endpoint. So, you must also specify the source IP address or VPC network.
        #
        #     A reachability analysis proceeds even if the source location is
        #     ambiguous. However, the test result may include endpoints that you don't
        #     intend to test.
        # @!attribute [rw] destination
        #   @return [::Google::Cloud::NetworkManagement::V1::Endpoint]
        #     Required. Destination specification of the Connectivity Test.
        #
        #     You can use a combination of destination IP address, Compute Engine
        #     VM instance, or VPC network to uniquely identify the destination
        #     location.
        #
        #     Even if the destination IP address is not unique, the source IP
        #     location is unique. Usually, the analysis can infer the destination
        #     endpoint from route information.
        #
        #     If the destination you specify is a VM instance and the instance has
        #     multiple network interfaces, then you must also specify either
        #     a destination IP address  or VPC network to identify the destination
        #     interface.
        #
        #     A reachability analysis proceeds even if the destination location is
        #     ambiguous. However, the result can include endpoints that you don't
        #     intend to test.
