        # Request for the `ListConnectivityTests` method.
        # @!attribute [rw] parent
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Required. The parent resource of the Connectivity Tests:
        #         `projects/{project_id}/locations/global`
        # @!attribute [rw] page_size
        #   @return [::Integer]
        #     Number of `ConnectivityTests` to return.
        # @!attribute [rw] page_token
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Page token from an earlier query, as returned in `next_page_token`.
        # @!attribute [rw] filter
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Lists the `ConnectivityTests` that match the filter expression. A filter
        #     expression filters the resources listed in the response. The expression
        #     must be of the form `<field> <operator> <value>` where operators: `<`, `>`,
        #     `<=`,
        #     `>=`,
        #     `!=`, `=`, `:` are supported (colon `:` represents a HAS operator which is
        #     roughly synonymous with equality). <field> can refer to a proto or JSON
        #     field, or a synthetic field. Field names can be camelCase or snake_case.
        #
        #     Examples:
        #     - Filter by name:
        #       name = "projects/proj-1/locations/global/connectivityTests/test-1
        #
        #     - Filter by labels:
        #       - Resources that have a key called `foo`
        #         labels.foo:*
        #       - Resources that have a key called `foo` whose value is `bar`
        #         labels.foo = bar
        # @!attribute [rw] order_by
        #   @return [::String]
