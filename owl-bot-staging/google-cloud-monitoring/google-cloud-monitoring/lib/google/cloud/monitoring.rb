      # ## About AlertPolicyService
      #
      # The AlertPolicyService API is used to manage (list, create, delete,
      # edit) alert policies in Cloud Monitoring. An alerting policy is
      # a description of the conditions under which some aspect of your
      # system is considered to be "unhealthy" and the ways to notify
      # people or services about this state. In addition to using this API, alert
      # policies can also be managed through
      # [Cloud Monitoring](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/docs/),
      # which can be reached by clicking the "Monitoring" tab in
      # [Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
      #
      # @param version [::String, ::Symbol] The API version to connect to. Optional.
      #   Defaults to `:v3`.

      #
      # ## About GroupService
      #
      # The Group API lets you inspect and manage your
      # [groups](#google.monitoring.v3.Group).
      #
      # A group is a named filter that is used to identify
      # a collection of monitored resources. Groups are typically used to
      # mirror the physical and/or logical topology of the environment.
      # Because group membership is computed dynamically, monitored
      # resources that are started in the future are automatically placed
      # in matching groups. By using a group to name monitored resources in,
      # for example, an alert policy, the target of that alert policy is
      # updated automatically as monitored resources are added and removed
      # from the infrastructure.
