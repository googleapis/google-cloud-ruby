# Snippet for the get_parameter_version call in the ParameterManager service
#
# This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code
# template only. It will require modifications to work:
# - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
# - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service
# client as shown in https://cloud.google.com/ruby/docs/reference.
#
# This is an auto-generated example demonstrating basic usage of
# Google::Cloud::ParameterManager::V1::ParameterManager::Client#get_parameter_version.
#
def get_parameter_version
  # Create a client object. The client can be reused for multiple calls.
  client = Google::Cloud::ParameterManager::V1::ParameterManager::Client.new

  # Create a request. To set request fields, pass in keyword arguments.
  request = Google::Cloud::ParameterManager::V1::GetParameterVersionRequest.new

  # Call the get_parameter_version method.
  result = client.get_parameter_version request

  # The returned object is of type Google::Cloud::ParameterManager::V1::ParameterVersion.
  p result
