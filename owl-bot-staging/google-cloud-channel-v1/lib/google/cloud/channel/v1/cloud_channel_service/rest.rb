        ##
        # CloudChannelService lets Google cloud resellers and distributors manage
        # their customers, channel partners, entitlements, and reports.
        #
        # Using this service:
        # 1. Resellers and distributors can manage a customer entity.
        # 2. Distributors can register an authorized reseller in their channel and
        #    provide them with delegated admin access.
        # 3. Resellers and distributors can manage customer entitlements.
        #
        # CloudChannelService exposes the following resources:
        # - {::Google::Cloud::Channel::V1::Customer Customer}s: An entity-usually an
        # enterprise-managed by a reseller or distributor.
        #
        # - {::Google::Cloud::Channel::V1::Entitlement Entitlement}s: An entity that
        # provides a customer with the means to use a service. Entitlements are created
        # or updated as a result of a successful fulfillment.
        #
        # - {::Google::Cloud::Channel::V1::ChannelPartnerLink ChannelPartnerLink}s: An
        # entity that identifies links between distributors and their indirect
        # resellers in a channel.
        #
        # To load this service and instantiate a REST client:
        #
        #     require "google/cloud/channel/v1/cloud_channel_service/rest"
        #     client = ::Google::Cloud::Channel::V1::CloudChannelService::Rest::Client.new
        #
        module CloudChannelService
          # Client for the REST transport
          module Rest
          end
        end
