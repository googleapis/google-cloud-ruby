Using the Video Stitcher API, you can monetize your video-on-demand (VOD) and livestreaming videos by inserting ads as described by metadata stored on ad servers. Note that google-cloud-video-stitcher-v1 is a version-specific client library. For most uses, we recommend installing the main client library google-cloud-video-stitcher instead. See the readme for more details.",
