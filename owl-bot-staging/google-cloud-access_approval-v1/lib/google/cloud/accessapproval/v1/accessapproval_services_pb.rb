          # This API allows a customer to manage accesses to cloud resources by
          # Google personnel. It defines the following resource model:
          #
          # - The API has a collection of
          #   [ApprovalRequest][google.cloud.accessapproval.v1.ApprovalRequest]
          #   resources, named `approvalRequests/{approval_request}`
          # - The API has top-level settings per Project/Folder/Organization, named
          #   `accessApprovalSettings`
          #
          # The service also periodically emails a list of recipients, defined at the
          # Project/Folder/Organization level in the accessApprovalSettings, when there
          # is a pending ApprovalRequest for them to act on. The ApprovalRequests can
          # also optionally be published to a Pub/Sub topic owned by the customer
          # (contact support if you would like to enable Pub/Sub notifications).
          #
          # ApprovalRequests can be approved or dismissed. Google personnel can only
          # access the indicated resource or resources if the request is approved
          # (subject to some exclusions:
          # https://cloud.google.com/access-approval/docs/overview#exclusions).
          #
          # Note: Using Access Approval functionality will mean that Google may not be
          # able to meet the SLAs for your chosen products, as any support response times
          # may be dramatically increased. As such the SLAs do not apply to any service
          # disruption to the extent impacted by Customer's use of Access Approval. Do
          # not enable Access Approval for projects where you may require high service
          # availability and rapid response by Google Cloud Support.
          #
          # After a request is approved or dismissed, no further action may be taken on
          # it. Requests with the requested_expiration in the past or with no activity
          # for 14 days are considered dismissed. When an approval expires, the request
          # is considered dismissed.
          #
          # If a request is not approved or dismissed, we call it pending.
