        ##
        # This API allows a customer to manage accesses to cloud resources by
        # Google personnel. It defines the following resource model:
        #
        # - The API has a collection of
        #   {::Google::Cloud::AccessApproval::V1::ApprovalRequest ApprovalRequest}
        #   resources, named `approvalRequests/{approval_request}`
        # - The API has top-level settings per Project/Folder/Organization, named
        #   `accessApprovalSettings`
        #
        # The service also periodically emails a list of recipients, defined at the
        # Project/Folder/Organization level in the accessApprovalSettings, when there
        # is a pending ApprovalRequest for them to act on. The ApprovalRequests can
        # also optionally be published to a Pub/Sub topic owned by the customer
        # (contact support if you would like to enable Pub/Sub notifications).
        #
        # ApprovalRequests can be approved or dismissed. Google personnel can only
        # access the indicated resource or resources if the request is approved
        # (subject to some exclusions:
        # https://cloud.google.com/access-approval/docs/overview#exclusions).
        #
        # Note: Using Access Approval functionality will mean that Google may not be
        # able to meet the SLAs for your chosen products, as any support response times
        # may be dramatically increased. As such the SLAs do not apply to any service
        # disruption to the extent impacted by Customer's use of Access Approval. Do
        # not enable Access Approval for projects where you may require high service
        # availability and rapid response by Google Cloud Support.
        #
        # After a request is approved or dismissed, no further action may be taken on
        # it. Requests with the requested_expiration in the past or with no activity
        # for 14 days are considered dismissed. When an approval expires, the request
        # is considered dismissed.
        #
        # If a request is not approved or dismissed, we call it pending.
        #
