        # Cloud Security Command Center (Cloud SCC) notification configs.
        #
        # A notification config is a Cloud SCC resource that contains the configuration
        # to send notifications for create/update events of findings, assets and etc.
        # @!attribute [rw] name
        #   @return [::String]
        #     The relative resource name of this notification config. See:
        #     https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names#relative_resource_name
        #     Example:
        #     "organizations/\\{organization_id}/notificationConfigs/notify_public_bucket".
        # @!attribute [rw] description
        #   @return [::String]
        #     The description of the notification config (max of 1024 characters).
        # @!attribute [rw] pubsub_topic
        #   @return [::String]
        #     The Pub/Sub topic to send notifications to. Its format is
        #     "projects/[project_id]/topics/[topic]".
        # @!attribute [r] service_account
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Output only. The service account that needs "pubsub.topics.publish"
        #     permission to publish to the Pub/Sub topic.
        # @!attribute [rw] streaming_config
        #   @return [::Google::Cloud::SecurityCenter::V1::NotificationConfig::StreamingConfig]
        #     The config for triggering streaming-based notifications.

          # The config for streaming-based notifications, which send each event as soon
          # as it is detected.
          # @!attribute [rw] filter
          #   @return [::String]
          #     Expression that defines the filter to apply across create/update events
          #     of assets or findings as specified by the event type. The expression is a
          #     list of zero or more restrictions combined via logical operators `AND`
          #     and `OR`. Parentheses are supported, and `OR` has higher precedence than
          #     `AND`.
          #
          #     Restrictions have the form `<field> <operator> <value>` and may have a
          #     `-` character in front of them to indicate negation. The fields map to
          #     those defined in the corresponding resource.
          #
          #     The supported operators are:
          #
          #     * `=` for all value types.
          #     * `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` for integer values.
          #     * `:`, meaning substring matching, for strings.
          #
          #     The supported value types are:
          #
          #     * string literals in quotes.
          #     * integer literals without quotes.
          #     * boolean literals `true` and `false` without quotes.
