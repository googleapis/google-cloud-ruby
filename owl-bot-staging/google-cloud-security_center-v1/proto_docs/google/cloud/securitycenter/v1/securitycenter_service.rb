        #
        #     * `=` for all value types.
        #     * `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` for integer values.

        #
        #     Possible "state_change" values when compare_duration is specified:

        #     * "REMOVED": indicates that the asset was present at the start of
        #                    compare_duration, but not present at reference_time.
        #     * "ACTIVE":  indicates that the asset was present at both the
        #                    start and the end of the time period defined by
        #                    compare_duration and reference_time.
        #
        #     If compare_duration is not specified, then the only possible state_change
        #     is "UNUSED", which will be the state_change set for all assets present at
        #     read_time.

        #     Restrictions have the form `<field> <operator> <value>` and may have a `-`

        #      * source_properties.a_property
        #      * security_marks.marks.marka

        #     * `=` for all value types.
        #     * `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` for integer values.
        #     * `:`, meaning substring matching, for strings.

        #     The supported value types are:

        #     * string literals in quotes.
        #     * integer literals without quotes.
        #     * boolean literals `true` and `false` without quotes.

        #
        #       Usage: This should be milliseconds since epoch or an RFC3339 string.
        #       Examples:
        #         `event_time = "2019-06-10T16:07:18-07:00"`
        #         `event_time = 1560208038000`

        #     * security_marks.marks: `=`, `:`
        #     * source_properties: `=`, `:`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
        #
        #       For example, `source_properties.size = 100` is a valid filter string.
        #
        #       Use a partial match on the empty string to filter based on a property

        #
        #     The state_change value is derived based on the presence and state of the

        #
        #     Possible "state_change" values when compare_duration is specified:
        #

        #                      filter at the start of compare_duration, but changed its
        #                      state at read_time.
        #     * "UNCHANGED": indicates that the finding was present and matched the given
        #                      filter at the start of compare_duration and did not change
        #                      state at read_time.
        #     * "ADDED":     indicates that the finding did not match the given filter or
        #                      was not present at the start of compare_duration, but was
        #                      present at read_time.
        #     * "REMOVED":   indicates that the finding was present and matched the

        #                      the filter at read_time.
        #
        #     If compare_duration is not specified, then the only possible state_change
