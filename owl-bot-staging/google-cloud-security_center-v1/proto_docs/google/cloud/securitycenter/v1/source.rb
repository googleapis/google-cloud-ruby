        # Security Command Center finding source. A finding source
        # is an entity or a mechanism that can produce a finding. A source is like a
        # container of findings that come from the same scanner, logger, monitor, and
        # other tools.
        # @!attribute [rw] name
        #   @return [::String]
        #     The relative resource name of this source. See:
        #     https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names#relative_resource_name
        #     Example:
        #     "organizations/\\{organization_id}/sources/\\{source_id}"
        # @!attribute [rw] display_name
        #   @return [::String]
        #     The source's display name.
        #     A source's display name must be unique amongst its siblings, for example,
        #     two sources with the same parent can't share the same display name.
        #     The display name must have a length between 1 and 64 characters
        #     (inclusive).
        # @!attribute [rw] description
        #   @return [::String]
        #     The description of the source (max of 1024 characters).
        #     Example:
        #     "Web Security Scanner is a web security scanner for common
        #     vulnerabilities in App Engine applications. It can automatically
        #     scan and detect four common vulnerabilities, including cross-site-scripting
        #     (XSS), Flash injection, mixed content (HTTP in HTTPS), and
        #     outdated or insecure libraries."
        # @!attribute [rw] canonical_name
        #   @return [::String]
        #     The canonical name of the finding. It's either
        #     "organizations/\\{organization_id}/sources/\\{source_id}",
        #     "folders/\\{folder_id}/sources/\\{source_id}" or
        #     "projects/\\{project_number}/sources/\\{source_id}",
        #     depending on the closest CRM ancestor of the resource associated with the
        #     finding.
