        # Exfiltration represents a data exfiltration attempt of one or more
        # sources to one or more targets.  Sources represent the source
        # of data that is exfiltrated, and Targets represents the destination the
        # data was copied to.

        #     them. For instance, BigQuery can join multiple tables, and each
        #     table would be considered a source.
