module Google
  module Iam
    module V1
      # Defines an Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy. It is used to
      # specify access control policies for Cloud Platform resources.
      #
      #
      # A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more
      # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,
      # Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
      # permissions (defined by IAM or configured by users). A `binding` can
      # optionally specify a `condition`, which is a logic expression that further
      # constrains the role binding based on attributes about the request and/or
      # target resource.
      #
      # **JSON Example**

      # @!attribute [rw] version
      #   @return [::Integer]
      #     Specifies the format of the policy.
      #
      #     Valid values are 0, 1, and 3. Requests specifying an invalid value will be
      #     rejected.
      #
      #     Operations affecting conditional bindings must specify version 3. This can
      #     be either setting a conditional policy, modifying a conditional binding,
      #     or removing a binding (conditional or unconditional) from the stored
      #     conditional policy.
      #     Operations on non-conditional policies may specify any valid value or
      #     leave the field unset.
      #
      #     If no etag is provided in the call to `setIamPolicy`, version compliance
      #     checks against the stored policy is skipped.
      # @!attribute [rw] bindings
      #   @return [::Array<::Google::Iam::V1::Binding>]
      #     Associates a list of `members` to a `role`. Optionally may specify a
      #     `condition` that determines when binding is in effect.
      #     `bindings` with no members will result in an error.
      # @!attribute [rw] etag
      #   @return [::String]
      #     `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      #     prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other.
      #     It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the
      #     read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      #     conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      #     systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to
      #     ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy.
      #
      #     If no `etag` is provided in the call to `setIamPolicy`, then the existing
      #     policy is overwritten. Due to blind-set semantics of an etag-less policy,
      #     'setIamPolicy' will not fail even if the incoming policy version does not
      #     meet the requirements for modifying the stored policy.
