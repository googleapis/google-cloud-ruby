        # Policy Simulator API service.
        #
        # Policy Simulator is a collection of endpoints for creating, running, and
        # viewing a {::Google::Cloud::PolicySimulator::V1::Replay Replay}. A
        # {::Google::Cloud::PolicySimulator::V1::Replay Replay} is a type of simulation that
        # lets you see how your principals' access to resources might change if you
        # changed your IAM policy.
        #
        # During a {::Google::Cloud::PolicySimulator::V1::Replay Replay}, Policy Simulator
        # re-evaluates, or replays, past access attempts under both the current policy
        # and  your proposed policy, and compares those results to determine how your
        # principals' access might change under the proposed policy.
        #
        # To load this service and instantiate a REST client:
        #
        #     require "google/cloud/policy_simulator/v1/simulator/rest"
        #     client = ::Google::Cloud::PolicySimulator::V1::Simulator::Rest::Client.new

        module Simulator
          # Client for the REST transport
