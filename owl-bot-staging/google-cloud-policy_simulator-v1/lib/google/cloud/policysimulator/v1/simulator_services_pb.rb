          # Policy Simulator is a collection of endpoints for creating, running, and
          # viewing a [Replay][google.cloud.policysimulator.v1.Replay]. A
          # [Replay][google.cloud.policysimulator.v1.Replay] is a type of simulation that
          # lets you see how your principals' access to resources might change if you
          # changed your IAM policy.
          #
          # During a [Replay][google.cloud.policysimulator.v1.Replay], Policy Simulator
          # re-evaluates, or replays, past access attempts under both the current policy
          # and  your proposed policy, and compares those results to determine how your
          # principals' access might change under the proposed policy.
