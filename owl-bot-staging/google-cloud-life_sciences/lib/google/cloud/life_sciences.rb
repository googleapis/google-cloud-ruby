      # Create a new client object for WorkflowsService.
      #
      # By default, this returns an instance of
      # [Google::Cloud::LifeSciences::V2beta::WorkflowsService::Client](https://cloud.google.com/ruby/docs/reference/google-cloud-life_sciences-v2beta/latest/Google-Cloud-LifeSciences-V2beta-WorkflowsService-Client)
      # for a gRPC client for version V2beta of the API.
      # However, you can specify a different API version by passing it in the
      # `version` parameter. If the WorkflowsService service is
      # supported by that API version, and the corresponding gem is available, the
      # appropriate versioned client will be returned.
      # You can also specify a different transport by passing `:rest` or `:grpc` in
      # the `transport` parameter.
      #
      # ## About WorkflowsService
      #
      # A service for running workflows, such as pipelines consisting of Docker
      # containers.
      #
      # @param version [::String, ::Symbol] The API version to connect to. Optional.
      #   Defaults to `:v2beta`.
      # @param transport [:grpc, :rest] The transport to use. Defaults to `:grpc`.
      # @return [::Object] A client object for the specified version.
