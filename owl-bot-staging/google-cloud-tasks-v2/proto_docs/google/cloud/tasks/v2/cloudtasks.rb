        #     Required. The task to add.

        #     Task names have the following format:
        #     `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/queues/QUEUE_ID/tasks/TASK_ID`.
        #     The user can optionally specify a task {::Google::Cloud::Tasks::V2::Task#name name}. If a
        #     name is not specified then the system will generate a random
        #     unique task id, which will be set in the task returned in the
        #     {::Google::Cloud::Tasks::V2::Task#name response}.
        #
        #     If {::Google::Cloud::Tasks::V2::Task#schedule_time schedule_time} is not set or is in the
        #     past then Cloud Tasks will set it to the current time.
        #
        #     Task De-duplication:
        #
        #     Explicitly specifying a task ID enables task de-duplication.  If
        #     a task's ID is identical to that of an existing task or a task
        #     that was deleted or executed recently then the call will fail
        #     with [ALREADY_EXISTS][google.rpc.Code.ALREADY_EXISTS].
        #     If the task's queue was created using Cloud Tasks, then another task with
        #     the same name can't be created for ~1hour after the original task was
        #     deleted or executed. If the task's queue was created using queue.yaml or
        #     queue.xml, then another task with the same name can't be created
        #     for ~9days after the original task was deleted or executed.
        #
        #     Because there is an extra lookup cost to identify duplicate task
        #     names, these {::Google::Cloud::Tasks::V2::CloudTasks::Client#create_task CreateTask} calls have significantly
        #     increased latency. Using hashed strings for the task id or for
        #     the prefix of the task id is recommended. Choosing task ids that
        #     are sequential or have sequential prefixes, for example using a
        #     timestamp, causes an increase in latency and error rates in all
        #     task commands. The infrastructure relies on an approximately
        #     uniform distribution of task ids to store and serve tasks
        #     efficiently.
