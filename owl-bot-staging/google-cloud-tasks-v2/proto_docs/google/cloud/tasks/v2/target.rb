        # HTTP request.
        #
        # The task will be pushed to the worker as an HTTP request. If the worker
        # or the redirected worker acknowledges the task by returning a successful HTTP
        # response code ([`200` - `299`]), the task will be removed from the queue. If
        # any other HTTP response code is returned or no response is received, the
        # task will be retried according to the following:
        #
        # * User-specified throttling: {::Google::Cloud::Tasks::V2::Queue#retry_config retry configuration},
        #   {::Google::Cloud::Tasks::V2::Queue#rate_limits rate limits}, and the [queue's state][google.cloud.tasks.v2.Queue.state].
        #
        # * System throttling: To prevent the worker from overloading, Cloud Tasks may
        #   temporarily reduce the queue's effective rate. User-specified settings
        #   will not be changed.
        #
        #  System throttling happens because:
        #
        #   * Cloud Tasks backs off on all errors. Normally the backoff specified in
        #     {::Google::Cloud::Tasks::V2::Queue#rate_limits rate limits} will be used. But if the worker returns
        #     `429` (Too Many Requests), `503` (Service Unavailable), or the rate of
        #     errors is high, Cloud Tasks will use a higher backoff rate. The retry
        #     specified in the `Retry-After` HTTP response header is considered.
        #
        #   * To prevent traffic spikes and to smooth sudden increases in traffic,
        #     dispatches ramp up slowly when the queue is newly created or idle and
        #     if large numbers of tasks suddenly become available to dispatch (due to
        #     spikes in create task rates, the queue being unpaused, or many tasks
        #     that are scheduled at the same time).
        # @!attribute [rw] url
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Required. The full url path that the request will be sent to.
        #
        #     This string must begin with either "http://" or "https://". Some examples
        #     are: `http://acme.com` and `https://acme.com/sales:8080`. Cloud Tasks will
        #     encode some characters for safety and compatibility. The maximum allowed
        #     URL length is 2083 characters after encoding.
        #
        #     The `Location` header response from a redirect response [`300` - `399`]
        #     may be followed. The redirect is not counted as a separate attempt.
        # @!attribute [rw] http_method

        #     HTTP request headers.
        #
        #     This map contains the header field names and values.
        #     Headers can be set when the
        #     [task is created][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.CloudTasks.CreateTask].
        #
        #     These headers represent a subset of the headers that will accompany the
        #     task's HTTP request. Some HTTP request headers will be ignored or replaced.
        #
        #     A partial list of headers that will be ignored or replaced is:
        #
        #     * Host: This will be computed by Cloud Tasks and derived from
        #       {::Google::Cloud::Tasks::V2::HttpRequest#url HttpRequest.url}.
        #     * Content-Length: This will be computed by Cloud Tasks.
        #     * User-Agent: This will be set to `"Google-Cloud-Tasks"`.
        #     * X-Google-*: Google use only.
        #     * X-AppEngine-*: Google use only.
        #
        #     `Content-Type` won't be set by Cloud Tasks. You can explicitly set
        #     `Content-Type` to a media type when the
        #      [task is created][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.CloudTasks.CreateTask].
        #      For example, `Content-Type` can be set to `"application/octet-stream"` or
        #      `"application/json"`.
        #
        #     Headers which can have multiple values (according to RFC2616) can be
        #     specified using comma-separated values.
        #
        #     The size of the headers must be less than 80KB.

        #

        # Traffic is encrypted during transport and never leaves Google datacenters.
        # Because this traffic is carried over a communication mechanism internal to
        # Google, you cannot explicitly set the protocol (for example, HTTP or HTTPS).
        # The request to the handler, however, will appear to have used the HTTP

        #
        # The {::Google::Cloud::Tasks::V2::AppEngineRouting AppEngineRouting} used to construct the URL that the task is
        # delivered to can be set at the queue-level or task-level:

        #     Repeated headers are not supported but a header value can contain commas.
        #
        #     Cloud Tasks sets some headers to default values:
        #
        #     * `User-Agent`: By default, this header is
        #       `"AppEngine-Google; (+http://code.google.com/appengine)"`.
        #       This header can be modified, but Cloud Tasks will append
        #       `"AppEngine-Google; (+http://code.google.com/appengine)"` to the
        #       modified `User-Agent`.
        #
        #     If the task has a {::Google::Cloud::Tasks::V2::AppEngineHttpRequest#body body}, Cloud
        #     Tasks sets the following headers:
        #
        #     * `Content-Type`: By default, the `Content-Type` header is set to
        #       `"application/octet-stream"`. The default can be overridden by explicitly
        #       setting `Content-Type` to a particular media type when the
        #       {::Google::Cloud::Tasks::V2::CloudTasks::Client#create_task task is created}.
        #       For example, `Content-Type` can be set to `"application/json"`.
        #     * `Content-Length`: This is computed by Cloud Tasks. This value is
        #       output only.   It cannot be changed.
        #
        #     The headers below cannot be set or overridden:
        #
        #     * `Host`
        #     * `X-Google-*`
        #     * `X-AppEngine-*`
        #
        #     In addition, Cloud Tasks sets some headers when the task is dispatched,
        #     such as headers containing information about the task; see
        #     [request
        #     headers](https://cloud.google.com/tasks/docs/creating-appengine-handlers#reading_request_headers).
        #     These headers are set only when the task is dispatched, so they are not
        #     visible when the task is returned in a Cloud Tasks response.
        #
        #     Although there is no specific limit for the maximum number of headers or
        #     the size, there is a limit on the maximum size of the {::Google::Cloud::Tasks::V2::Task Task}. For more
