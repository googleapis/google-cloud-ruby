        #     The task name.
        #
        #     The task name must have the following format:
        #     `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/queues/QUEUE_ID/tasks/TASK_ID`
        #
        #     * `PROJECT_ID` can contain letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers ([0-9]),
        #        hyphens (-), colons (:), or periods (.).
        #        For more information, see
        #        [Identifying
        #        projects](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#identifying_projects)
        #     * `LOCATION_ID` is the canonical ID for the task's location.
        #        The list of available locations can be obtained by calling
        #        {::Google::Cloud::Location::Locations::Client#list_locations ListLocations}.
        #        For more information, see https://cloud.google.com/about/locations/.
        #     * `QUEUE_ID` can contain letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers ([0-9]), or
        #       hyphens (-). The maximum length is 100 characters.
        #     * `TASK_ID` can contain only letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers ([0-9]),
        #       hyphens (-), or underscores (_). The maximum length is 500 characters.

        #
        #     An App Engine task is a task that has
        #     {::Google::Cloud::Tasks::V2::AppEngineHttpRequest AppEngineHttpRequest} set.
        # @!attribute [rw] http_request
        #   @return [::Google::Cloud::Tasks::V2::HttpRequest]

        # @!attribute [rw] schedule_time
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Timestamp]
        #     The time when the task is scheduled to be attempted or retried.
        #

        # @!attribute [rw] create_time
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Timestamp]
        #     Output only. The time that the task was created.
        #
        #     `create_time` will be truncated to the nearest second.
        # @!attribute [rw] dispatch_deadline
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Duration]
        #     The deadline for requests sent to the worker. If the worker does not
        #     respond by this deadline then the request is cancelled and the attempt
        #     is marked as a `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED` failure. Cloud Tasks will retry the
        #     task according to the {::Google::Cloud::Tasks::V2::RetryConfig RetryConfig}.
        #
        #     Note that when the request is cancelled, Cloud Tasks will stop listening
        #     for the response, but whether the worker stops processing depends on the
        #     worker. For example, if the worker is stuck, it may not react to cancelled
        #     requests.
        #
        #     The default and maximum values depend on the type of request:
        #
        #     * For {::Google::Cloud::Tasks::V2::HttpRequest HTTP tasks}, the default is 10
        #     minutes. The deadline
        #       must be in the interval [15 seconds, 30 minutes].
        #
        #     * For {::Google::Cloud::Tasks::V2::AppEngineHttpRequest App Engine tasks}, 0
        #     indicates that the
        #       request has the default deadline. The default deadline depends on the
        #       [scaling
        #       type](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/go/how-instances-are-managed#instance_scaling)
        #       of the service: 10 minutes for standard apps with automatic scaling, 24
        #       hours for standard apps with manual and basic scaling, and 60 minutes for
        #       flex apps. If the request deadline is set, it must be in the interval [15
        #       seconds, 24 hours 15 seconds]. Regardless of the task's
        #       `dispatch_deadline`, the app handler will not run for longer than than
        #       the service's timeout. We recommend setting the `dispatch_deadline` to
        #       at most a few seconds more than the app handler's timeout. For more
        #       information see
        #       [Timeouts](https://cloud.google.com/tasks/docs/creating-appengine-handlers#timeouts).
