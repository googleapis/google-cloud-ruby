        # Google Cloud Memorystore for Redis v1
        #
        # The `redis.googleapis.com` service implements the Google Cloud Memorystore
        # for Redis API and defines the following resource model for managing Redis
        # instances:
        # * The service works with a collection of cloud projects, named: `/projects/*`
        # * Each project has a collection of available locations, named: `/locations/*`
        # * Each location has a collection of Redis instances, named: `/instances/*`
        # * As such, Redis instances are resources of the form:
        #   `/projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/instances/{instance_id}`
        #
        # Note that location_id must be referring to a GCP `region`; for example:
        # * `projects/redpepper-1290/locations/us-central1/instances/my-redis`
        #
        # To load this service and instantiate a REST client:
        #
        #     require "google/cloud/redis/v1/cloud_redis/rest"
        #     client = ::Google::Cloud::Redis::V1::CloudRedis::Rest::Client.new
