        # A Firestore document.
        #
        # Must not exceed 1 MiB - 4 bytes.
        # @!attribute [rw] name
        #   @return [::String]
        #     The resource name of the document, for example
        #     `projects/{project_id}/databases/{database_id}/documents/{document_path}`.
        # @!attribute [rw] fields
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Map{::String => ::Google::Cloud::Firestore::V1::Value}]
        #     The document's fields.
        #
        #     The map keys represent field names.
        #
        #     A simple field name contains only characters `a` to `z`, `A` to `Z`,
        #     `0` to `9`, or `_`, and must not start with `0` to `9`. For example,
        #     `foo_bar_17`.
        #
        #     Field names matching the regular expression `__.*__` are reserved. Reserved
        #     field names are forbidden except in certain documented contexts. The map
        #     keys, represented as UTF-8, must not exceed 1,500 bytes and cannot be
        #     empty.
        #
        #     Field paths may be used in other contexts to refer to structured fields
        #     defined here. For `map_value`, the field path is represented by the simple
        #     or quoted field names of the containing fields, delimited by `.`. For
        #     example, the structured field
        #     `"foo" : { map_value: { "x&y" : { string_value: "hello" }}}` would be
        #     represented by the field path `foo.x&y`.
        #
        #     Within a field path, a quoted field name starts and ends with `` ` `` and
        #     may contain any character. Some characters, including `` ` ``, must be
        #     escaped using a `\`. For example, `` `x&y` `` represents `x&y` and
        #     `` `bak\`tik` `` represents `` bak`tik ``.

        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Timestamp]

        #
        #     This value increases monotonically when a document is deleted then
        #     recreated. It can also be compared to values from other documents and
        #     the `read_time` of a query.

        #
        #     This value is initially set to the `create_time` then increases
        #     monotonically with each change to the document. It can also be
        #     compared to values from other documents and the `read_time` of a query.
