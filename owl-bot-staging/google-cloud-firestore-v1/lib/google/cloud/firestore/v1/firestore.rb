        # The Cloud Firestore service.
        #
        # Cloud Firestore is a fast, fully managed, serverless, cloud-native NoSQL
        # document database that simplifies storing, syncing, and querying data for
        # your mobile, web, and IoT apps at global scale. Its client libraries provide
        # live synchronization and offline support, while its security features and
        # integrations with Firebase and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) accelerate
        # building truly serverless apps.
        #
        # To load this service and instantiate a client:
        #
        #     require "google/cloud/firestore/v1/firestore"
        #     client = ::Google::Cloud::Firestore::V1::Firestore::Client.new
        #
        module Firestore
