              # Cloud Spanner Instance Admin API
              #
              # The Cloud Spanner Instance Admin API can be used to create, delete,
              # modify and list instances. Instances are dedicated Cloud Spanner serving
              # and storage resources to be used by Cloud Spanner databases.
              #
              # Each instance has a "configuration", which dictates where the
              # serving resources for the Cloud Spanner instance are located (e.g.,
              # US-central, Europe). Configurations are created by Google based on
              # resource availability.
              #
              # Cloud Spanner billing is based on the instances that exist and their
              # sizes. After an instance exists, there are no additional
              # per-database or per-operation charges for use of the instance
              # (though there may be additional network bandwidth charges).
              # Instances offer isolation: problems with databases in one instance
              # will not affect other instances. However, within an instance
              # databases can affect each other. For example, if one database in an
              # instance receives a lot of requests and consumes most of the
              # instance resources, fewer resources are available for other
              # databases in that instance, and their performance may suffer.
