        # Service for collecting and viewing traces and spans within a trace.
        #
        # A trace is a collection of spans corresponding to a single
        # operation or a set of operations in an application.
        #
        # A span is an individual timed event which forms a node of the trace tree.
        # A single trace can contain spans from multiple services.
        #
