        # A span represents a single operation within a trace. Spans can be
        # nested to form a trace tree. Often, a trace contains a root span
        # that describes the end-to-end latency, and one or more subspans for
        # its sub-operations.
        #
        # A trace can also contain multiple root spans, or none at all.
        # Spans do not need to be contiguous. There might be
        # gaps or overlaps between spans in a trace.
        # @!attribute [rw] name

        #      * `projects/[PROJECT_ID]/traces/[TRACE_ID]/spans/[SPAN_ID]`
        #
        #     `[TRACE_ID]` is a unique identifier for a trace within a project;
        #     it is a 32-character hexadecimal encoding of a 16-byte array. It should
        #     not be zero.
        #
        #     `[SPAN_ID]` is a unique identifier for a span within a trace; it
        #     is a 16-character hexadecimal encoding of an 8-byte array. It should not
        #     be zero.

        #     Cloud Trace displays the description in the
        #     Cloud console.
        #     For example, the display name can be a qualified method name or a file name
        #     and a line number where the operation is called. A best practice is to use
        #     the same display name within an application and at the same call point.
