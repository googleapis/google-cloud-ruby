          # The Cloud Firestore Admin API.
          #
          # This API provides several administrative services for Cloud Firestore.
          #
          # Project, Database, Namespace, Collection, Collection Group, and Document are
          # used as defined in the Google Cloud Firestore API.
          #
          # Operation: An Operation represents work being performed in the background.
          #
          # The index service manages Cloud Firestore indexes.
          #
          # Index creation is performed asynchronously.
          # An Operation resource is created for each such asynchronous operation.
          # The state of the operation (including any errors encountered)
          # may be queried via the Operation resource.
          #
          # The Operations collection provides a record of actions performed for the
          # specified Project (including any Operations in progress). Operations are not
          # created directly but through calls on other collections or resources.
          #
          # An Operation that is done may be deleted so that it is no longer listed as
          # part of the Operation collection. Operations are garbage collected after
          # 30 days. By default, ListOperations will only return in progress and failed
          # operations. To list completed operation, issue a ListOperations request with
          # the filter `done: true`.
          #
          # Operations are created by service `FirestoreAdmin`, but are accessed via
          # service `google.longrunning.Operations`.
          #
          # To load this service and instantiate a REST client:
          #
          #     require "google/cloud/firestore/admin/v1/firestore_admin/rest"
          #     client = ::Google::Cloud::Firestore::Admin::V1::FirestoreAdmin::Rest::Client.new
          #
          module FirestoreAdmin
            # Client for the REST transport
            module Rest
