            # The Cloud Firestore Admin API.
            #
            # This API provides several administrative services for Cloud Firestore.
            #
            # Project, Database, Namespace, Collection, Collection Group, and Document are
            # used as defined in the Google Cloud Firestore API.
            #
            # Operation: An Operation represents work being performed in the background.
            #
            # The index service manages Cloud Firestore indexes.
            #
            # Index creation is performed asynchronously.
            # An Operation resource is created for each such asynchronous operation.
            # The state of the operation (including any errors encountered)
            # may be queried via the Operation resource.
            #
            # The Operations collection provides a record of actions performed for the
            # specified Project (including any Operations in progress). Operations are not
            # created directly but through calls on other collections or resources.
            #
            # An Operation that is done may be deleted so that it is no longer listed as
            # part of the Operation collection. Operations are garbage collected after
            # 30 days. By default, ListOperations will only return in progress and failed
            # operations. To list completed operation, issue a ListOperations request with
            # the filter `done: true`.
