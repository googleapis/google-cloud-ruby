        #
        #      * `gs://bucket_name/dir/*`: matches all files in the `bucket_name/dir`
        #                                  directory
        #      * `gs://bucket_name/dir/**`: matches all files in the `bucket_name/dir`
        #                                   and all subdirectories recursively
        #      * `gs://bucket_name/file*`: matches files prefixed by `file` in
        #                                  `bucket_name`
        #      * `gs://bucket_name/??.txt`: matches files with two characters followed by
        #                                   `.txt` in `bucket_name`
        #      * `gs://bucket_name/[aeiou].txt`: matches files that contain a single
        #                                        vowel character followed by `.txt` in
        #                                        `bucket_name`
        #      * `gs://bucket_name/[a-m].txt`: matches files that contain `a`, `b`, ...
        #                                      or `m` followed by `.txt` in `bucket_name`
        #      * `gs://bucket_name/a/*/b`: matches all files in `bucket_name` that match
        #                                  the `a/*/b` pattern, such as `a/c/b`, `a/d/b`
        #      * `gs://another_bucket/a.txt`: matches `gs://another_bucket/a.txt`
        # @!attribute [rw] file_type
        #   @return [::String]
        #     File type in MIME format, for example, `text/plain`.
