        # The GKE Hub MembershipService handles the registration of many Kubernetes
        # clusters to Google Cloud, represented with the
        # {::Google::Cloud::GkeHub::V1beta1::Membership Membership} resource.
        #
        # GKE Hub is currently available in the global region and all regions in
        # https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones.
        #
        # **Membership management may be non-trivial:** it is recommended to use one
        # of the Google-provided client libraries or tools where possible when working
        # with Membership resources.
        #
        # @example Load this service and instantiate a gRPC client
        #
        #     require "google/cloud/gke_hub/v1beta1/gke_hub_membership_service"
        #     client = ::Google::Cloud::GkeHub::V1beta1::GkeHubMembershipService::Client.new
        #
        # @example Load this service and instantiate a REST client
        #
