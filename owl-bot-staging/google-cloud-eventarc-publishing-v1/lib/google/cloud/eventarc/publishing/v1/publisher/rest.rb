          # Eventarc processes events generated by an event provider and delivers them to
          # a subscriber.
          #
          # An event provider is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) system or
          # product that can generate and deliver events through Eventarc.
          #
          # A third-party event provider is an event provider from outside of Google.
          #
          # A partner is a third-party event provider that is integrated with Eventarc.
          #
          # A subscriber is a GCP customer interested in receiving events.
          #
          # Channel is a first-class Eventarc resource that is created and managed
          # by the subscriber in their GCP project. A Channel represents a subscriber's
          # intent to receive events from an event provider. A Channel is associated with
          # exactly one event provider.
          #
          # ChannelConnection is a first-class Eventarc resource that
          # is created and managed by the partner in their GCP project. A
          # ChannelConnection represents a connection between a partner and a
          # subscriber's Channel. A ChannelConnection has a one-to-one mapping with a
          # Channel.
          #
          # Publisher allows an event provider to publish events to Eventarc.
