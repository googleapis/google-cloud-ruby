Eventarc requires no infrastructure management — you can optimize productivity and costs while building a modern, event-driven solution. Note that google-cloud-eventarc-publishing-v1 is a version-specific client library. For most uses, we recommend installing the main client library google-cloud-eventarc-publishing instead. See the readme for more details.",
