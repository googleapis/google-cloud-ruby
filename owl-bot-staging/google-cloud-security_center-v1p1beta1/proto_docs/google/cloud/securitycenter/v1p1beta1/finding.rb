        # Security Command Center finding.
        #
        # A finding is a record of assessment data (security, risk, health or privacy)
        # ingested into Security Command Center for presentation, notification,
        # analysis, policy testing, and enforcement. For example, an XSS vulnerability
        # in an App Engine application is a finding.
        # @!attribute [rw] name
        #   @return [::String]
        #     The relative resource name of this finding. See:
        #     https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names#relative_resource_name
        #     Example:
        #     "organizations/\\{organization_id}/sources/\\{source_id}/findings/\\{finding_id}"
        # @!attribute [rw] parent
        #   @return [::String]
        #     The relative resource name of the source the finding belongs to. See:
        #     https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names#relative_resource_name
        #     This field is immutable after creation time.
        #     For example:
        #     "organizations/\\{organization_id}/sources/\\{source_id}"
        # @!attribute [rw] resource_name
        #   @return [::String]
        #     For findings on Google Cloud resources, the full resource
        #     name of the Google Cloud resource this finding is for. See:
        #     https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names#full_resource_name
        #     When the finding is for a non-Google Cloud resource, the resourceName can
        #     be a customer or partner defined string. This field is immutable after
        #     creation time.
        # @!attribute [rw] state
        #   @return [::Google::Cloud::SecurityCenter::V1p1beta1::Finding::State]
        #     The state of the finding.
        # @!attribute [rw] category
        #   @return [::String]
        #     The additional taxonomy group within findings from a given source.
        #     This field is immutable after creation time.
        #     Example: "XSS_FLASH_INJECTION"
        # @!attribute [rw] external_uri
        #   @return [::String]
        #     The URI that, if available, points to a web page outside of Security
        #     Command Center where additional information about the finding can be found.

        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Map{::String => ::Google::Protobuf::Value}]
        #     Source specific properties. These properties are managed by the source
        #     that writes the finding. The key names in the source_properties map must be
        #     between 1 and 255 characters, and must start with a letter and contain
        #     alphanumeric characters or underscores only.

        #   @return [::Google::Cloud::SecurityCenter::V1p1beta1::SecurityMarks]

        #     managed by the user and come from the SecurityMarks resource that belongs
        #     to the finding.
        # @!attribute [rw] event_time
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Timestamp]
        #     The time at which the event took place, or when an update to the finding
        #     occurred. For example, if the finding represents an open firewall it would
        #     capture the time the detector believes the firewall became open. The
        #     accuracy is determined by the detector. If the finding were to be resolved
        #     afterward, this time would reflect when the finding was resolved. Must not
        #     be set to a value greater than the current timestamp.
        # @!attribute [rw] create_time
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Timestamp]
