        #     read_time.
        #
        #     The state_change value is derived based on the presence and state of the

        #                      filter at the start of compare_duration, but changed its
        #                      state at read_time.
        #     * "UNCHANGED": indicates that the finding was present and matched the given
        #                      filter at the start of compare_duration and did not change
        #                      state at read_time.
        #     * "ADDED":     indicates that the finding did not match the given filter or
        #                      was not present at the start of compare_duration, but was
        #                      present at read_time.
        #     * "REMOVED":   indicates that the finding was present and matched the

        #                      the filter at read_time.
        #
        #     If compare_duration is not specified, then the only possible state_change
