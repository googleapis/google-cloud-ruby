  module Type
    # Represents a whole or partial calendar date, such as a birthday. The time of
    # day and time zone are either specified elsewhere or are insignificant. The
    # date is relative to the Gregorian Calendar. This can represent one of the
    # following:
    #
    # * A full date, with non-zero year, month, and day values
    # * A month and day value, with a zero year, such as an anniversary
    # * A year on its own, with zero month and day values
    # * A year and month value, with a zero day, such as a credit card expiration
    # date
    #
    # Related types are {::Google::Type::TimeOfDay google.type.TimeOfDay} and
    # `google.protobuf.Timestamp`.
    # @!attribute [rw] year
    #   @return [::Integer]
    #     Year of the date. Must be from 1 to 9999, or 0 to specify a date without
    #     a year.
    # @!attribute [rw] month
    #   @return [::Integer]
    #     Month of a year. Must be from 1 to 12, or 0 to specify a year without a
    #     month and day.
    # @!attribute [rw] day
    #   @return [::Integer]
    #     Day of a month. Must be from 1 to 31 and valid for the year and month, or 0
    #     to specify a year by itself or a year and month where the day isn't
    #     significant.
