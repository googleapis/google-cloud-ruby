        #
        #     `required_attributes` is a list; `required_one_of_attributes` uses a

        #     conjunction/AND operation across the collection of `VehicleAttributeList`.
        #     Each repeated string should be of the format

        #
        #     Restricts the response to vehicles that match all the attributes in a
        #     `VehicleAttributeList`. Within each list, a vehicle must match all of the

        #     `VehicleAttributeList` and inclusive disjunction/OR operation across the
        #     collection of `VehicleAttributeList`. Each repeated string should be of the

        #     Optional. A filter query to apply when listing vehicles. See
        #     http://aip.dev/160 for examples of the filter syntax.
        #
        #     This field is designed to replace the `required_attributes`,
        #     `required_one_of_attributes`, and `required_one_of_attributes_sets` fields.
        #     If a non-empty value is specified here, the following fields must be empty:
        #     `required_attributes`, `required_one_of_attributes`, and
        #     `required_one_of_attributes_sets`.
        #
        #     This filter functions as an AND clause with other constraints,
        #     such as `vehicle_state` or `on_trip_only`.
        #
        #     Note that the only queries supported are on vehicle attributes (for
        #     example, `attributes.<key> = <value>` or `attributes.<key1> = <value1> AND
        #     attributes.<key2> = <value2>`). The maximum number of restrictions allowed
        #     in a filter query is 50.
        #
        #     Also, all attributes are stored as strings, so the only supported
        #     comparisons against attributes are string comparisons. In order to compare
        #     against number or boolean values, the values must be explicitly quoted to
        #     be treated as strings (for example, `attributes.<key> = "10"` or
        #     `attributes.<key> = "true"`).
