      # Create a new client object for EdgeNetwork.
      #
      # By default, this returns an instance of
      # [Google::Cloud::EdgeNetwork::V1::EdgeNetwork::Client](https://cloud.google.com/ruby/docs/reference/google-cloud-edge_network-v1/latest/Google-Cloud-EdgeNetwork-V1-EdgeNetwork-Client)
      # for a gRPC client for version V1 of the API.
      # However, you can specify a different API version by passing it in the
      # `version` parameter. If the EdgeNetwork service is
      # supported by that API version, and the corresponding gem is available, the
      # appropriate versioned client will be returned.
      # You can also specify a different transport by passing `:rest` or `:grpc` in
      # the `transport` parameter.
      #
      # ## About EdgeNetwork
      #
      # EdgeNetwork API provides managed, highly available cloud dynamic network
      # configuration service to the GEC customer to enable edge application and
      # network function solutions. This allows the customers to easily define and
      # configure the network setup and property to meet the workload requirement.
      #
      # @param version [::String, ::Symbol] The API version to connect to. Optional.
      #   Defaults to `:v1`.
      # @param transport [:grpc, :rest] The transport to use. Defaults to `:grpc`.
      # @return [::Object] A client object for the specified version.
