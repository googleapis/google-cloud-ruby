# Snippet for the create_space call in the SpacesService service
#
# This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code
# template only. It will require modifications to work:
# - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
# - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service
# client as shown in https://cloud.google.com/ruby/docs/reference.
#
# This is an auto-generated example demonstrating basic usage of
# Google::Apps::Meet::V2::SpacesService::Client#create_space.
#
def create_space
  # Create a client object. The client can be reused for multiple calls.
  client = Google::Apps::Meet::V2::SpacesService::Client.new

  # Create a request. To set request fields, pass in keyword arguments.
  request = Google::Apps::Meet::V2::CreateSpaceRequest.new

  # Call the create_space method.
  result = client.create_space request

  # The returned object is of type Google::Apps::Meet::V2::Space.
  p result
