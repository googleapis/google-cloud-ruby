        #
        # The `memcache.googleapis.com` service implements the Google Cloud Memorystore
        # for Memcached API and defines the following resource model for managing
        # Memorystore Memcached (also called Memcached below) instances:
        # * The service works with a collection of cloud projects, named: `/projects/*`
        # * Each project has a collection of available locations, named: `/locations/*`
        # * Each location has a collection of Memcached instances, named:
        # `/instances/*`
        # * As such, Memcached instances are resources of the form:
        #   `/projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/instances/{instance_id}`
        #
        # Note that location_id must be a GCP `region`; for example:
        # * `projects/my-memcached-project/locations/us-central1/instances/my-memcached`
        #
        # To load this service and instantiate a client:
        #
        #     require "google/cloud/memcache/v1/cloud_memcache"
        #     client = ::Google::Cloud::Memcache::V1::CloudMemcache::Client.new
