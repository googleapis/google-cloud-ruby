Cloud Build can import source code from Google Cloud Storage, Cloud Source Repositories, GitHub, or Bitbucket, execute a build to your specifications, and produce artifacts such as Docker containers or Java archives. Note that google-cloud-build-v1 is a version-specific client library. For most uses, we recommend installing the main client library google-cloud-build instead. See the readme for more details.",
