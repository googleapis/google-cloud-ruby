        # API Overview
        #
        # Certificates Manager API allows customers to see and manage all their TLS
        # certificates.
        #
        # Certificates Manager API service provides methods to manage certificates,
        # group them into collections, and create serving configuration that can be
        # easily applied to other Cloud resources e.g. Target Proxies.
        #
        # Data Model
        #
        # The Certificates Manager service exposes the following resources:
        #
        # * `Certificate` which describes a single TLS certificate.
        # * `CertificateMap` which describes a collection of certificates that can be
        # attached to a target resource.
        # * `CertificateMapEntry` which describes a single configuration entry that
        # consists of a SNI and a group of certificates. It's a subresource of
        # CertificateMap.
        #
        # Certificate, CertificateMap and CertificateMapEntry IDs
        # have to match "^[a-z0-9-]\\{1,63}$" regexp, which means that
        # - only lower case letters, digits, and hyphen are allowed
        # - length of the resource ID has to be in [1,63] range.
        #
        # Provides methods to manage Cloud Certificate Manager entities.
        #
        # To load this service and instantiate a client:
        #
        #     require "google/cloud/certificate_manager/v1/certificate_manager"
        #     client = ::Google::Cloud::CertificateManager::V1::CertificateManager::Client.new
        #
        module CertificateManager
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
