        # A card interface displayed in a Google Chat message or Google Workspace
        # add-on.
        #
        # Cards support a defined layout, interactive UI elements like buttons, and
        # rich media like images. Use cards to present detailed information,
        # gather information from users, and guide users to take a next step.

        #
        # To learn how
        # to build cards, see the following documentation:
        #
        # * For Google Chat apps, see [Design the components of a card or
        #   dialog](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/design-components-card-dialog).
        # * For Google Workspace add-ons, see [Card-based
        # interfaces](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/add-ons/concepts/cards).
        #
        # Note: You can add up to 100 widgets per card. Any widgets beyond this
        # limit are ignored. This limit applies to both card messages and dialogs
        # in Google Chat apps, and to cards in Google Workspace add-ons.
