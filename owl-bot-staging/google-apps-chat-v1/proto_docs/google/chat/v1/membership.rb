        #     and overwrite anything specified.
        #
        #     When a Chat app creates a membership relation for a human user, it must use
        #     certain authorization scopes and set specific values for certain fields:
        #
        #     - When [authenticating as a
        #     user](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-user),
        #     the `chat.memberships` authorization scope is required.
        #
        #     - When [authenticating as an
        #     app](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-app),
        #     the `chat.app.memberships` authorization scope is required.
        #     Authenticating as an app is available in [Developer
        #     Preview](https://developers.google.com/workspace/preview).
        #
        #     - Set `user.type` to `HUMAN`, and set `user.name` with format
        #     `users/{user}`, where `{user}` can be the email address for the user. For
        #     users in the same Workspace organization `{user}` can also be the `id` of
        #     the [person](https://developers.google.com/people/api/rest/v1/people) from
        #     the People API, or the `id` for the user in the Directory API. For example,
        #     if the People API Person profile ID for `user@example.com` is `123456789`,
        #     you can add the user to the space by setting the `membership.member.name`
        #     to `users/user@example.com` or `users/123456789`.
        #
        #     Inviting users external to the Workspace organization that owns the space

        #     To filter by role, set `role` to `ROLE_MEMBER` or `ROLE_MANAGER`.
        #
        #     To filter by type, set `member.type` to `HUMAN` or `BOT`. You can also
        #     filter for `member.type` using the `!=` operator.
        #
        #     To filter by both role and type, use the `AND` operator. To filter by
        #     either role or type, use the `OR` operator.
        #
        #     Either `member.type = "HUMAN"` or `member.type != "BOT"` is required
        #     when `use_admin_access` is set to true. Other member type filters will be

        #     ```
