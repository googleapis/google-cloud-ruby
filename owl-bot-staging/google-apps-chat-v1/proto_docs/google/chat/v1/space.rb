        #      If you receive the error message `ALREADY_EXISTS`, try a different
        #      value. An existing space within the
        #     Google Workspace organization might already use this display name.
        #
        #     `space_type`: Only supports changing a `GROUP_CHAT` space type to
        #     `SPACE`. Include `display_name` together
        #     with `space_type` in the update mask and ensure that the specified space

        #     history on or off for the space. Only supported if history settings are

        #     space history state, you must omit all other field masks in your request.
        #     `space_history_state` is not supported with `useAdminAccess`.
        #
        #     `access_settings.audience`: Updates the [access
        #     setting](https://support.google.com/chat/answer/11971020) of who can
        #     discover the space, join the space, and preview the messages in named space
        #     where `spaceType` field is `SPACE`. If the existing space has a
        #     target audience, you can remove the audience and restrict space access by
        #     omitting a value for this field mask. To update access settings for a
        #     space, the authenticating user must be a space manager and omit all other

        #     of a space.
        #     When updating permission settings, you can only specify

        # @!attribute [rw] query
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Required. A search query.
        #
        #     You can search by using the following parameters:
        #
        #     - `create_time`
        #     - `customer`
        #     - `display_name`
        #     - `external_user_allowed`
        #     - `last_active_time`
        #     - `space_history_state`
        #     - `space_type`
        #
        #     `create_time` and `last_active_time` accept a timestamp in
        #     [RFC-3339](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339) format and the supported
        #     comparison operators are: `=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`.
        #
        #     `customer` is required and is used to indicate which customer
        #     to fetch spaces from. `customers/my_customer` is the only supported value.
        #
        #     `display_name` only accepts the `HAS` (`:`) operator. The text to
        #     match is first tokenized into tokens and each token is prefix-matched
        #     case-insensitively and independently as a substring anywhere in the space's
        #     `display_name`. For example, `Fun Eve` matches `Fun event` or `The
        #     evening was fun`, but not `notFun event` or `even`.
        #
        #     `external_user_allowed` accepts either `true` or `false`.
        #
        #     `space_history_state` only accepts values from the [`historyState`]
        #     (https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/api/reference/rest/v1/spaces#Space.HistoryState)
        #     field of a `space` resource.
        #
        #     `space_type` is required and the only valid value is `SPACE`.
        #
        #     Across different fields, only `AND` operators are supported. A valid
        #     example is `space_type = "SPACE" AND display_name:"Hello"` and an invalid
        #     example is `space_type = "SPACE" OR display_name:"Hello"`.
        #
        #     Among the same field,
        #     `space_type` doesn't support `AND` or `OR` operators.
        #     `display_name`, 'space_history_state', and 'external_user_allowed' only
        #     support `OR` operators.
        #     `last_active_time` and `create_time` support both `AND` and `OR` operators.
        #     `AND` can only be used to represent an interval, such as `last_active_time
        #     < "2022-01-01T00:00:00+00:00" AND last_active_time >
        #     "2023-01-01T00:00:00+00:00"`.
        #
        #     The following example queries are valid:
        #
        #     ```
        #     customer = "customers/my_customer" AND space_type = "SPACE"
        #

        #     "2022-01-01T00:00:00+00:00")
        #
        #     customer = "customers/my_customer" AND space_type = "SPACE" AND

        # @!attribute [rw] order_by

        #     Optional. How the list of spaces is ordered.

        #     - `membership_count.joined_direct_human_user_count` — Denotes the count of

        #     - `last_active_time` — Denotes the time when last eligible item is added to
        #     any topic of this space.
        #     - `create_time` — Denotes the time of the space creation.
        #
