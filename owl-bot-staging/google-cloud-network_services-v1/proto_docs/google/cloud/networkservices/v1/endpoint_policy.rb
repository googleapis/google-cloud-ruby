        # EndpointPolicy is a resource that helps apply desired configuration
        # on the endpoints that match specific criteria.
        # For example, this resource can be used to apply "authentication config"
        # an all endpoints that serve on port 8080.
        # @!attribute [rw] name
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Required. Name of the EndpointPolicy resource. It matches pattern
        #     `projects/{project}/locations/global/endpointPolicies/{endpoint_policy}`.
        # @!attribute [r] create_time
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Timestamp]
        #     Output only. The timestamp when the resource was created.
        # @!attribute [r] update_time
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Timestamp]
        #     Output only. The timestamp when the resource was updated.
        # @!attribute [rw] labels
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Map{::String => ::String}]
        #     Optional. Set of label tags associated with the EndpointPolicy resource.
        # @!attribute [rw] type
        #   @return [::Google::Cloud::NetworkServices::V1::EndpointPolicy::EndpointPolicyType]
        #     Required. The type of endpoint policy. This is primarily used to validate
        #     the configuration.
        # @!attribute [rw] authorization_policy
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Optional. This field specifies the URL of AuthorizationPolicy resource that
        #     applies authorization policies to the inbound traffic at the
        #     matched endpoints. Refer to Authorization. If this field is not
        #     specified, authorization is disabled(no authz checks) for this
        #     endpoint.
        # @!attribute [rw] endpoint_matcher
        #   @return [::Google::Cloud::NetworkServices::V1::EndpointMatcher]
        #     Required. A matcher that selects endpoints to which the policies should be
        #     applied.
        # @!attribute [rw] traffic_port_selector
        #   @return [::Google::Cloud::NetworkServices::V1::TrafficPortSelector]
        #     Optional. Port selector for the (matched) endpoints. If no port selector is
        #     provided, the matched config is applied to all ports.
        # @!attribute [rw] description
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Optional. A free-text description of the resource. Max length 1024

        # @!attribute [rw] server_tls_policy
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Optional. A URL referring to ServerTlsPolicy resource. ServerTlsPolicy is
        #     used to determine the authentication policy to be applied to terminate the
        #     inbound traffic at the identified backends. If this field is not set,
        #     authentication is disabled(open) for this endpoint.
        # @!attribute [rw] client_tls_policy
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Optional. A URL referring to a ClientTlsPolicy resource. ClientTlsPolicy
        #     can be set to specify the authentication for traffic from the proxy to the
        #     actual endpoints. More specifically, it is applied to the outgoing traffic
        #     from the proxy to the endpoint. This is typically used for sidecar model
        #     where the proxy identifies itself as endpoint to the control plane, with
        #     the connection between sidecar and endpoint requiring authentication. If
        #     this field is not set, authentication is disabled(open). Applicable only
        #     when EndpointPolicyType is SIDECAR_PROXY.
