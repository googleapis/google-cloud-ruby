        # @!attribute [rw] hostnames
        #   @return [::Array<::String>]
        #     Required. Hostnames define a set of hosts that should match against the
        #     HTTP host header to select a HttpRoute to process the request. Hostname is
        #     the fully qualified domain name of a network host, as defined by RFC 1123
        #     with the exception that:
        #      - IPs are not allowed.
        #      - A hostname may be prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`). The wildcard
        #        label must appear by itself as the first label.
        #
        #     Hostname can be "precise" which is a domain name without the terminating
        #     dot of a network host (e.g. `foo.example.com`) or "wildcard", which is a
        #     domain name prefixed with a single wildcard label (e.g. `*.example.com`).
        #
        #     Note that as per RFC1035 and RFC1123, a label must consist of lower case
        #     alphanumeric characters or '-', and must start and end with an alphanumeric
        #     character. No other punctuation is allowed.
        #
        #     The routes associated with a Mesh or Gateways  must have unique hostnames.
        #     If you attempt to attach multiple routes with conflicting hostnames,
        #     the configuration will be rejected.
        #
        #     For example, while it is acceptable for routes for the hostnames
        #     `*.foo.bar.com` and `*.bar.com` to be associated with the same Mesh (or
        #     Gateways under the same scope), it is not possible to associate two routes
        #     both with `*.bar.com` or both with `bar.com`.

        #
        #     Each mesh reference should match the pattern:

        #     gateway.
        #
