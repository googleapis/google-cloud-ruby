        ##
        # A service for managing Google Workspace Add-ons deployments.
        #
        # A Google Workspace Add-on is a third-party embedded component that can be
        # installed in Google Workspace Applications like Gmail, Calendar, Drive, and
        # the Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides editors. Google Workspace Add-ons can
        # display UI cards, receive contextual information from the host application,
        # and perform actions in the host application (See:
        # https://developers.google.com/gsuite/add-ons/overview for more information).
        #
        # A Google Workspace Add-on deployment resource specifies metadata about the
        # add-on, including a specification of the entry points in the host application
        # that trigger add-on executions (see:
        # https://developers.google.com/gsuite/add-ons/concepts/gsuite-manifests).
        # Add-on deployments defined via the Google Workspace Add-ons API define their
        # entrypoints using HTTPS URLs (See:
        # https://developers.google.com/gsuite/add-ons/guides/alternate-runtimes),
        #
        # A Google Workspace Add-on deployment can be installed in developer mode,
        # which allows an add-on developer to test the experience an end-user would see
        # when installing and running the add-on in their G Suite applications.  When
        # running in developer mode, more detailed error messages are exposed in the
        # add-on UI to aid in debugging.
        #
        # A Google Workspace Add-on deployment can be published to Google Workspace
        # Marketplace, which allows other Google Workspace users to discover and
        # install the add-on.  See:
        # https://developers.google.com/gsuite/add-ons/how-tos/publish-add-on-overview
        # for details.
        #
        # To load this service and instantiate a REST client:
        #
        #     require "google/cloud/gsuite_add_ons/v1/gsuite_add_ons/rest"
        #     client = ::Google::Cloud::GSuiteAddOns::V1::GSuiteAddOns::Rest::Client.new
        #
        module GSuiteAddOns
          # Client for the REST transport
          module Rest
          end
        end
