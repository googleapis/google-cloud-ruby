          # A service for managing Google Workspace Add-ons deployments.
          #
          # A Google Workspace Add-on is a third-party embedded component that can be
          # installed in Google Workspace Applications like Gmail, Calendar, Drive, and
          # the Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides editors. Google Workspace Add-ons can
          # display UI cards, receive contextual information from the host application,
          # and perform actions in the host application (See:
          # https://developers.google.com/gsuite/add-ons/overview for more information).
          #
          # A Google Workspace Add-on deployment resource specifies metadata about the
          # add-on, including a specification of the entry points in the host application
          # that trigger add-on executions (see:
          # https://developers.google.com/gsuite/add-ons/concepts/gsuite-manifests).
          # Add-on deployments defined via the Google Workspace Add-ons API define their
          # entrypoints using HTTPS URLs (See:
          # https://developers.google.com/gsuite/add-ons/guides/alternate-runtimes),
          #
          # A Google Workspace Add-on deployment can be installed in developer mode,
          # which allows an add-on developer to test the experience an end-user would see
          # when installing and running the add-on in their G Suite applications.  When
          # running in developer mode, more detailed error messages are exposed in the
          # add-on UI to aid in debugging.
          #
          # A Google Workspace Add-on deployment can be published to Google Workspace
          # Marketplace, which allows other Google Workspace users to discover and
          # install the add-on.  See:
          # https://developers.google.com/gsuite/add-ons/how-tos/publish-add-on-overview
          # for details.
