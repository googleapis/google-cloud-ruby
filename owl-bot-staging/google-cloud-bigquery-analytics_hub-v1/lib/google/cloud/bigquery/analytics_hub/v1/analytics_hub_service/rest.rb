          # The `AnalyticsHubService` API facilitates data sharing within and across
          # organizations. It allows data providers to publish listings that reference
          # shared datasets. With Analytics Hub, users can discover and search for
          # listings that they have access to. Subscribers can view and subscribe to
          # listings. When you subscribe to a listing, Analytics Hub creates a linked
          # dataset in your project.
          #
          # To load this service and instantiate a REST client:
          #
          #     require "google/cloud/bigquery/analytics_hub/v1/analytics_hub_service/rest"
          #     client = ::Google::Cloud::Bigquery::AnalyticsHub::V1::AnalyticsHubService::Rest::Client.new
