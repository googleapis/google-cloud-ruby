        # Request message for PurgeUserEvents method.
        # @!attribute [rw] parent
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Required. The resource name of the event_store under which the events are
        #     created. The format is
        #     `projects/${projectId}/locations/global/catalogs/${catalogId}/eventStores/${eventStoreId}`
        # @!attribute [rw] filter
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Required. The filter string to specify the events to be deleted. Empty
        #     string filter is not allowed. This filter can also be used with
        #     ListUserEvents API to list events that will be deleted. The eligible fields
        #     for filtering are:
        #     * eventType - UserEvent.eventType field of type string.
        #     * eventTime - in ISO 8601 "zulu" format.
        #     * visitorId - field of type string. Specifying this will delete all events
        #     associated with a visitor.
        #     * userId - field of type string. Specifying this will delete all events
        #     associated with a user.
        #     Example 1: Deleting all events in a time range.
        #     `eventTime > "2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z" eventTime <
        #     "2012-04-23T18:30:43.511Z"`
        #     Example 2: Deleting specific eventType in time range.
        #     `eventTime > "2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z" eventType = "detail-page-view"`
        #     Example 3: Deleting all events for a specific visitor
        #     `visitorId = visitor1024`
        #     The filtering fields are assumed to have an implicit AND.
        # @!attribute [rw] force
        #   @return [::Boolean]

        #     Optional. The url including cgi-parameters but excluding the hash fragment.
        #     The URL must be truncated to 1.5K bytes to conservatively be under the 2K
        #     bytes. This is often more useful than the referer url, because many

        # @!attribute [rw] page_size

        # @!attribute [rw] page_token
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Optional. The previous ListUserEventsResponse.next_page_token.
        # @!attribute [rw] filter
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Optional. Filtering expression to specify restrictions over
        #     returned events. This is a sequence of terms, where each term applies some
        #     kind of a restriction to the returned user events. Use this expression to
        #     restrict results to a specific time range, or filter events by eventType.
        #        eg: eventTime > "2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z" eventsMissingCatalogItems
        #        eventTime<"2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z" eventType=search
        #
        #       We expect only 3 types of fields:
        #
        #        * eventTime: this can be specified a maximum of 2 times, once with a
        #          less than operator and once with a greater than operator. The
        #          eventTime restrict should result in one contiguous valid eventTime
        #          range.
        #
        #        * eventType: only 1 eventType restriction can be specified.
        #
        #        * eventsMissingCatalogItems: specififying this will restrict results
        #          to events for which catalog items were not found in the catalog. The
        #          default behavior is to return only those events for which catalog
        #          items were found.
        #
        #       Some examples of valid filters expressions:
        #
        #       * Example 1: eventTime > "2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z"
        #                 eventTime < "2012-04-23T18:30:43.511Z"
        #       * Example 2: eventTime > "2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z"
        #                 eventType = detail-page-view
        #       * Example 3: eventsMissingCatalogItems
        #                 eventType = search eventTime < "2018-04-23T18:30:43.511Z"
        #       * Example 4: eventTime > "2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z"
