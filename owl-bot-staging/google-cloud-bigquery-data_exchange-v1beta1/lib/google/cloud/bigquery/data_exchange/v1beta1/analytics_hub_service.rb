          # The `AnalyticsHubService` API facilitates data sharing within and across
          # organizations. It allows data providers to publish listings that reference
          # shared datasets. With Analytics Hub, users can discover and search for
          # listings that they have access to. Subscribers can view and subscribe to
          # listings. When you subscribe to a listing, Analytics Hub creates a linked
          # dataset in your project.
