        #     A task's retry interval starts at
        #     {::Google::Cloud::Tasks::V2beta3::RetryConfig#min_backoff min_backoff}, then
        #     doubles `max_doublings` times, then increases linearly, and finally retries
        #     at intervals of
        #     {::Google::Cloud::Tasks::V2beta3::RetryConfig#max_backoff max_backoff} up to
        #     {::Google::Cloud::Tasks::V2beta3::RetryConfig#max_attempts max_attempts} times.
        #
        #     For example, if
        #     {::Google::Cloud::Tasks::V2beta3::RetryConfig#min_backoff min_backoff} is 10s,
        #     {::Google::Cloud::Tasks::V2beta3::RetryConfig#max_backoff max_backoff} is 300s,
        #     and `max_doublings` is 3, then the a task will first be retried in 10s. The
        #     retry interval will double three times, and then increase linearly by 2^3 *
        #     10s.  Finally, the task will retry at intervals of
        #     {::Google::Cloud::Tasks::V2beta3::RetryConfig#max_backoff max_backoff} until the
        #     task has been attempted
        #     {::Google::Cloud::Tasks::V2beta3::RetryConfig#max_attempts max_attempts} times.
        #     Thus, the requests will retry at 10s, 20s, 40s, 80s, 160s, 240s, 300s,
        #     300s, ....
