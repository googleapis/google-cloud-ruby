        #     The time between retries will double `max_doublings` times.
        #
        #     A task's retry interval starts at
        #     {::Google::Cloud::Tasks::V2beta3::RetryConfig#min_backoff min_backoff}, then doubles
        #     `max_doublings` times, then increases linearly, and finally
        #     retries at intervals of
        #     {::Google::Cloud::Tasks::V2beta3::RetryConfig#max_backoff max_backoff} up to
        #     {::Google::Cloud::Tasks::V2beta3::RetryConfig#max_attempts max_attempts} times.
        #
        #     For example, if {::Google::Cloud::Tasks::V2beta3::RetryConfig#min_backoff min_backoff} is 10s,
        #     {::Google::Cloud::Tasks::V2beta3::RetryConfig#max_backoff max_backoff} is 300s, and
        #     `max_doublings` is 3, then the a task will first be retried in
        #     10s. The retry interval will double three times, and then
        #     increase linearly by 2^3 * 10s.  Finally, the task will retry at
        #     intervals of {::Google::Cloud::Tasks::V2beta3::RetryConfig#max_backoff max_backoff} until the
        #     task has been attempted {::Google::Cloud::Tasks::V2beta3::RetryConfig#max_attempts max_attempts}
        #     times. Thus, the requests will retry at 10s, 20s, 40s, 80s, 160s,
        #     240s, 300s, 300s, ....
