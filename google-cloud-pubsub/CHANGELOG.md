### 2.0.0 / 2020-08-06

This is a major update that removes the "low-level" client interface code, and
instead adds the new `google-cloud-pubsub-v1` gem as a dependency.
The new dependency is a rewritten low-level client, produced by a next-
generation client code generator, with improved performance and stability.

This change should have no effect on the high-level interface that most users
will use. The one exception is that the (mostly undocumented) `client_config`
argument, for adjusting low-level parameters such as RPC retry settings on
client objects, has been removed. If you need to adjust these parameters, use
the configuration interface in `google-cloud-pubsub-v1`.

Substantial changes have been made in the low-level interfaces, however. If you
are using the low-level classes under the `Google::Cloud::PubSub::V1` module,
please review the docs for the new `google-cloud-pubsub-v1` gem. In
particular:

* Some classes have been renamed, notably the client classes themselves.
* The client constructor takes a configuration block instead of configuration
  keyword arguments.
* All RPC method arguments are now keyword arguments.

### 1.1.0 / 2019-10-23

#### Features

* Add support for Ordering Keys
  * Google Cloud Pub/Sub ordering keys provide the ability to ensure related

    The service guarantees that, for a given ordering key and publisher, messages
    are sent to subscribers in the order in which they were published.

    and requires special project enablements.

#### Bug Fixes

* Fix Subscriber state after releasing messages
  * Correctly reset the Subscriber state when releasing messages
    after the callback either raises an error, or the callback
    fails to call acknowledge or modify_ack_deadline on the
    message. If a Subscriber fills it's inventory, and stops
    pulling additional messages before all the callbacks are
    completed (moves to a paused state) then the Subscriber
    could become stuck in a paused state.
  * A paused Subscriber will now check whether to unpause after
    the callback is completed, instead of when acknowledge or
    modify_ack_deadline is called on the message.

### 1.0.1 / 2019-10-01

#### Bug Fixes

* Fix Subscriber lease issue
  * Fix logic for renewing Subscriber lease for messages.
    * Subscriptions with very low volume would only be renewed once.

### 0.37.0 / 2019-06-17

* Subscriber changes
  * Fix potential inventory bug
  * Messages are removed after callback
    * This change prevents the Subscriber inventory from filling up
      when messages are never acked or nacked in the user callback.
      This might happen due to an error in the user callback code.
      Removing a message from the inventory will cause the message to
      be redelivered and reprocessed.

  * Updates are now made using unary API calls, not the gRPC stream.

    * This change will help avoid race conditions by ensuring that
      inventory lease renewal actions don't override ack/nack/delay
      actions made on a received message via the Subscriber callback.
  * Changes to avoid potential race conditions in updates.
* Add reference?/resource? helper methods:
