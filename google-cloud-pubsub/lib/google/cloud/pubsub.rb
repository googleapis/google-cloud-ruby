    # # Google Cloud Pub/Sub
    #
    # Google Cloud Pub/Sub is designed to provide reliable, many-to-many,
    # asynchronous messaging between applications. Publisher applications can
    # send messages to a "topic" and other applications can subscribe to that
    # topic to receive the messages. By decoupling senders and receivers, Google
    # Cloud Pub/Sub allows developers to communicate between independently
    # written applications.
    #
    # See {file:OVERVIEW.md Google Cloud Pub/Sub Overview}.
    #
    module PubSub
      ##
      # Creates a new object for connecting to the Pub/Sub service.
      # Each call creates a new connection.
      #
      # For more information on connecting to Google Cloud see the
      # {file:AUTHENTICATION.md Authentication Guide}.
      #
      # @param [String] project_id Project identifier for the Pub/Sub service
      #   you are connecting to. If not present, the default project for the
      #   credentials is used.
      # @param [String, Hash, Google::Auth::Credentials] credentials The path to
      #   the keyfile as a String, the contents of the keyfile as a Hash, or a
      #   Google::Auth::Credentials object. (See {PubSub::Credentials})
      # @param [String, Array<String>] scope The OAuth 2.0 scopes controlling
      #   the set of resources and operations that the connection can access.
      #   See [Using OAuth 2.0 to Access Google
      #   APIs](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2).
      #
      #   The default scope is:
      #
      #   * `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/pubsub`
      # @param [Numeric] timeout Default timeout to use in requests. Optional.
      # @param [String] endpoint Override of the endpoint host name. Optional.
      #   If the param is nil, uses the default endpoint.
      # @param [String] emulator_host Pub/Sub emulator host. Optional.
      #   If the param is nil, uses the value of the `emulator_host` config.
      # @param [String] project Alias for the `project_id` argument. Deprecated.
      # @param [String] keyfile Alias for the `credentials` argument.
      #   Deprecated.

      # * `project_id` - (String) Identifier for a PubSub project. (The
      #   parameter `project` is considered deprecated, but may also be used.)
      # * `credentials` - (String, Hash, Google::Auth::Credentials) The path to
      #   the keyfile as a String, the contents of the keyfile as a Hash, or a
      #   Google::Auth::Credentials object. (See {PubSub::Credentials}) (The
      #   parameter `keyfile` is considered deprecated, but may also be used.)
      # * `scope` - (String, Array<String>) The OAuth 2.0 scopes controlling
      #   the set of resources and operations that the connection can access.
      # * `quota_project` - (String) The project ID for a project that can be
      #   used by client libraries for quota and billing purposes.
      # * `timeout` - (Numeric) Default timeout to use in requests.
      # * `endpoint` - (String) Override of the endpoint host name, or `nil`
      #   to use the default endpoint.
      # * `emulator_host` - (String) Host name of the emulator. Defaults to
      #   `ENV["PUBSUB_EMULATOR_HOST"]`
      # * `on_error` - (Proc) A Proc to be run when an error is encountered
      #   on a background thread. The Proc must take the error object as the
      #   single argument. (See {Subscriber.on_error}.)
      #
