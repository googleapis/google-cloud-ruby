        #     * `:use_legacy_flow_control` [Boolean] Disables enforcing flow control settings at the Cloud PubSub
        #       server and the less accurate method of only enforcing flow control at the client side is used instead.
        #       Default is false.
        #     * `:max_total_lease_duration` [Integer] The number of seconds that received messages can be held awaiting
        #       processing. Default is 3,600 (1 hour). (Note: replaces `:extension`, which is deprecated.)
        #     * `:max_duration_per_lease_extension` [Integer] The maximum amount of time in seconds for a single lease
        #       extension attempt. Bounds the delay before a message redelivery if the subscriber fails to extend the
        #       deadline. Default is 0 (disabled).
