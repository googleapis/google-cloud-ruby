        # Google Cloud Pub/Sub ordering keys provide the ability to ensure
        # related messages are sent to subscribers in the order in which they
        # were published. Messages can be tagged with an ordering key, a string
        # that identifies related messages for which publish order should be
        # respected. The service guarantees that, for a given ordering key and
        # publisher, messages are sent to subscribers in the order in which they
        # were published. Ordering does not require sacrificing high throughput
        # or scalability, as the service automatically distributes messages for
        # different ordering keys across subscribers.
        #
        # To use ordering keys, specify `ordering_key`. Before specifying
        # `ordering_key` on a message a call to `#enable_message_ordering!` must
        # be made or an error will be raised.
