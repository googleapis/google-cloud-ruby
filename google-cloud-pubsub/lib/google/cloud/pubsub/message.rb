        # that identifies related messages for which publish order should be
        # respected. The service guarantees that, for a given ordering key and
        # publisher, messages are sent to subscribers in the order in which they
        # were published. Ordering does not require sacrificing high throughput
        # or scalability, as the service automatically distributes messages for
        # different ordering keys across subscribers.
