      # Create a new client object for TablesService.
      #
      # By default, this returns an instance of
      # [Google::Area120::Tables::V1alpha1::TablesService::Client](https://rubydoc.info/gems/google-area120-tables-v1alpha1/Google/Area120/Tables/V1alpha1/TablesService/Client)
      # for a gRPC client for version V1alpha1 of the API.
      # However, you can specify a different API version by passing it in the
      # `version` parameter. If the TablesService service is
      # supported by that API version, and the corresponding gem is available, the
      # appropriate versioned client will be returned.
      # You can also specify a different transport by passing `:rest` or `:grpc` in
      # the `transport` parameter.
      #
      # Raises an exception if the currently installed versioned client gem for the
      # given API version does not support the given transport of the TablesService service.
      # You can determine whether the method will succeed by calling
      # {Google::Area120::Tables.tables_service_available?}.

      # ## About TablesService
      #
      # The Tables Service provides an API for reading and updating tables.
      # It defines the following resource model:
      #
      # - The API has a collection of Table
      #   resources, named `tables/*`
      #
      # - Each Table has a collection of Row
      #   resources, named `tables/*/rows/*`
      #
      # - The API has a collection of
      #   Workspace
      #   resources, named `workspaces/*`.
      #
      # @param version [::String, ::Symbol] The API version to connect to. Optional.
      #   Defaults to `:v1alpha1`.
      # @param transport [:grpc, :rest] The transport to use. Defaults to `:grpc`.
      # @return [::Object] A client object for the specified version.
      #
