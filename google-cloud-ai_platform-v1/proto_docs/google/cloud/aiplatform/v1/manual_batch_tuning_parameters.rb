        #     each batch to a machine replica. Machine type, and size of a single
        #     record should be considered when setting this parameter, higher value
        #     speeds up the batch operation's execution, but too high value will result
        #     in a whole batch not fitting in a machine's memory, and the whole
        #     operation will fail.
        #     The default value is 64.
