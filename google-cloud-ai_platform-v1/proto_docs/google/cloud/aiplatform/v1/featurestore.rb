        #   @return [::String]
        #     Output only. Name of the Featurestore. Format:

        #   @return [::String]
        #     Optional. Used to perform consistent read-modify-write updates. If not set, a blind

        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Map{::String => ::String}]

        #     (Unicode codepoints), can only contain lowercase letters, numeric
