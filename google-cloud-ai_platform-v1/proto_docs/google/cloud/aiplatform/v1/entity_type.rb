        # An entity type is a type of object in a system that needs to be modeled and
        # have stored information about. For example, driver is an entity type, and
        # driver0 is an instance of an entity type driver.
        # @!attribute [rw] name
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Immutable. Name of the EntityType.

        #
        #     The last part entity_type is assigned by the client. The entity_type can be
        #     up to 64 characters long and can consist only of ASCII Latin letters A-Z
        #     and a-z and underscore(_), and ASCII digits 0-9 starting with a letter. The
        #     value will be unique given a featurestore.
        # @!attribute [rw] description
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Optional. Description of the EntityType.
        # @!attribute [r] create_time

        #     Optional. The labels with user-defined metadata to organize your EntityTypes.
        #
        #     Label keys and values can be no longer than 64 characters
        #     (Unicode codepoints), can only contain lowercase letters, numeric
        #     characters, underscores and dashes. International characters are allowed.
