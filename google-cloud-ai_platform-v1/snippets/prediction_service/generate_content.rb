# Snippet for the generate_content call in the PredictionService service
#
# This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code
# template only. It will require modifications to work:
# - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
# - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service
# client as shown in https://cloud.google.com/ruby/docs/reference.
#
# This is an auto-generated example demonstrating basic usage of
# Google::Cloud::AIPlatform::V1::PredictionService::Client#generate_content.
#
def generate_content
  # Create a client object. The client can be reused for multiple calls.
  client = Google::Cloud::AIPlatform::V1::PredictionService::Client.new

  # Create a request. To set request fields, pass in keyword arguments.
  request = Google::Cloud::AIPlatform::V1::GenerateContentRequest.new

  # Call the generate_content method.
  result = client.generate_content request

  # The returned object is of type Google::Cloud::AIPlatform::V1::GenerateContentResponse.
  p result
