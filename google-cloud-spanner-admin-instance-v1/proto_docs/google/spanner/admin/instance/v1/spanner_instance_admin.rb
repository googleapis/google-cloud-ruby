            #     The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator

            #     Colon `:` is the contains operator. Filter rules are not case sensitive.

            #     The following fields in the {::Google::Longrunning::Operation Operation}
            #     are eligible for filtering:
            #
            #       * `name` - The name of the long-running operation
            #       * `done` - False if the operation is in progress, else true.
            #       * `metadata.@type` - the type of metadata. For example, the type string
            #          for
            #          {::Google::Cloud::Spanner::Admin::Instance::V1::CreateInstanceConfigMetadata CreateInstanceConfigMetadata}

            #          `metadata.@type` must be specified first, if filtering on metadata
            #          fields.
            #       * `error` - Error associated with the long-running operation.
            #       * `response.@type` - the type of response.
            #       * `response.<field_name>` - any field in response.value.
            #
            #     You can combine multiple expressions by enclosing each expression in
