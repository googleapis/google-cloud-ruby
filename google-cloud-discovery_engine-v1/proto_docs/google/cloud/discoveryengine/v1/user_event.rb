        # UserEvent captures all metadata information Discovery Engine API needs to
        # know about how end users interact with customers' website.
        # @!attribute [rw] event_type
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Required. User event type. Allowed values are:
        #
        #     Generic values:
        #
        #     * `search`: Search for Documents.
        #     * `view-item`: Detailed page view of a Document.
        #     * `view-item-list`: View of a panel or ordered list of Documents.
        #     * `view-home-page`: View of the home page.
        #     * `view-category-page`: View of a category page, e.g. Home > Men > Jeans
        #
        #     Retail-related values:
        #
        #     * `add-to-cart`: Add an item(s) to cart, e.g. in Retail online shopping
        #     * `purchase`: Purchase an item(s)
        #
        #     Media-related values:
        #
        #     * `media-play`: Start/resume watching a video, playing a song, etc.
        #     * `media-complete`: Finished or stopped midway through a video, song, etc.
        # @!attribute [rw] user_pseudo_id
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Required. A unique identifier for tracking visitors.
        #
        #     For example, this could be implemented with an HTTP cookie, which should be
        #     able to uniquely identify a visitor on a single device. This unique
        #     identifier should not change if the visitor log in/out of the website.
        #
        #     Do not set the field to the same fixed ID for different users. This mixes
        #     the event history of those users together, which results in degraded model
        #     quality.
        #
        #     The field must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 128
        #     characters. Otherwise, an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned.
        #
        #     The field should not contain PII or user-data. We recommend to use Google
        #     Analytics [Client
        #     ID](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/field-reference#clientId)
        #     for this field.
        # @!attribute [rw] event_time
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Timestamp]
        #     Only required for
        #     {::Google::Cloud::DiscoveryEngine::V1::UserEventService::Client#import_user_events UserEventService.ImportUserEvents}
        #     method. Timestamp of when the user event happened.
        # @!attribute [rw] user_info
        #   @return [::Google::Cloud::DiscoveryEngine::V1::UserInfo]
        #     Information about the end user.
        # @!attribute [rw] direct_user_request
        #   @return [::Boolean]
        #     Should set to true if the request is made directly from the end user, in
        #     which case the
        #     {::Google::Cloud::DiscoveryEngine::V1::UserInfo#user_agent UserEvent.user_info.user_agent}
        #     can be populated from the HTTP request.
        #
        #     This flag should be set only if the API request is made directly from the
        #     end user such as a mobile app (and not if a gateway or a server is
        #     processing and pushing the user events).
        #
        #     This should not be set when using the JavaScript tag in
        #     {::Google::Cloud::DiscoveryEngine::V1::UserEventService::Client#collect_user_event UserEventService.CollectUserEvent}.
        # @!attribute [rw] session_id
        #   @return [::String]
        #     A unique identifier for tracking a visitor session with a length limit of
        #     128 bytes. A session is an aggregation of an end user behavior in a time
        #     span.
        #
        #     A general guideline to populate the session_id:
        #
        #     1. If user has no activity for 30 min, a new session_id should be assigned.
        #     2. The session_id should be unique across users, suggest use uuid or add
        #     {::Google::Cloud::DiscoveryEngine::V1::UserEvent#user_pseudo_id UserEvent.user_pseudo_id}
        #     as prefix.
        # @!attribute [rw] page_info
        #   @return [::Google::Cloud::DiscoveryEngine::V1::PageInfo]
        #     Page metadata such as categories and other critical information for certain
        #     event types such as `view-category-page`.
        # @!attribute [rw] attribution_token
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Token to attribute an API response to user action(s) to trigger the event.
        #
        #     Highly recommended for user events that are the result of
        #     [RecommendationService.Recommend][]. This field enables accurate
        #     attribution of recommendation model performance.
        #
        #     The value must be one of:
        #
        #     * [RecommendResponse.attribution_token][] for events that are the result of
        #     [RecommendationService.Recommend][].
        #     * {::Google::Cloud::DiscoveryEngine::V1::SearchResponse#attribution_token SearchResponse.attribution_token} for events that are the result of
        #     {::Google::Cloud::DiscoveryEngine::V1::SearchService::Client#search SearchService.Search}.
        #
        #     This token enables us to accurately attribute page view or conversion
        #     completion back to the event and the particular predict response containing
        #     this clicked/purchased product. If user clicks on product K in the
        #     recommendation results, pass [RecommendResponse.attribution_token][] as a
        #     URL parameter to product K's page. When recording events on product K's
        #     page, log the [RecommendResponse.attribution_token][] to this field.
        # @!attribute [rw] filter
        #   @return [::String]
        #     The filter syntax consists of an expression language for constructing a
        #     predicate from one or more fields of the documents being filtered.
        #
        #     One example is for `search` events, the associated
        #     {::Google::Cloud::DiscoveryEngine::V1::SearchRequest SearchRequest} may contain
        #     a filter expression in
        #     {::Google::Cloud::DiscoveryEngine::V1::SearchRequest#filter SearchRequest.filter}
        #     conforming to https://google.aip.dev/160#filtering.
        #
        #     Similarly, for `view-item-list` events that are generated from a
        #     [RecommendRequest][], this field may be populated directly from
        #     [RecommendRequest.filter][] conforming to
        #     https://google.aip.dev/160#filtering.
        #
        #     The value must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 1,000
        #     characters. Otherwise, an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned.
        # @!attribute [rw] documents
        #   @return [::Array<::Google::Cloud::DiscoveryEngine::V1::DocumentInfo>]
        #     List of {::Google::Cloud::DiscoveryEngine::V1::Document Document}s associated
        #     with this user event.
        #
        #     This field is optional except for the following event types:
        #
        #     * `view-item`
        #     * `add-to-cart`
        #     * `purchase`
        #     * `media-play`
        #     * `media-complete`
        #
        #     In a `search` event, this field represents the documents returned to the
        #     end user on the current page (the end user may have not finished browsing
        #     the whole page yet). When a new page is returned to the end user, after
        #     pagination/filtering/ordering even for the same query, a new `search` event
        #     with different
        #     {::Google::Cloud::DiscoveryEngine::V1::UserEvent#documents UserEvent.documents}
        #     is desired.
        # @!attribute [rw] panel
        #   @return [::Google::Cloud::DiscoveryEngine::V1::PanelInfo]
        #     Panel metadata associated with this user event.
        # @!attribute [rw] search_info
        #   @return [::Google::Cloud::DiscoveryEngine::V1::SearchInfo]
        #     {::Google::Cloud::DiscoveryEngine::V1::SearchService::Client#search SearchService.Search}
        #     details related to the event.
        #
        #     This field should be set for `search` event.
        # @!attribute [rw] completion_info
        #   @return [::Google::Cloud::DiscoveryEngine::V1::CompletionInfo]
        #     {::Google::Cloud::DiscoveryEngine::V1::CompletionService::Client#complete_query CompletionService.CompleteQuery}
        #     details related to the event.
        #
        #     This field should be set for `search` event when autocomplete function is
        #     enabled and the user clicks a suggestion for search.
        # @!attribute [rw] transaction_info
        #   @return [::Google::Cloud::DiscoveryEngine::V1::TransactionInfo]
        #     The transaction metadata (if any) associated with this user event.
        # @!attribute [rw] tag_ids
        #   @return [::Array<::String>]
        #     A list of identifiers for the independent experiment groups this user event
        #     belongs to. This is used to distinguish between user events associated with
        #     different experiment setups on the customer end.
        # @!attribute [rw] promotion_ids
        #   @return [::Array<::String>]
        #     The promotion IDs if this is an event associated with promotions.
        #     Currently, this field is restricted to at most one ID.
        # @!attribute [rw] attributes
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Map{::String => ::Google::Cloud::DiscoveryEngine::V1::CustomAttribute}]
        #     Extra user event features to include in the recommendation model.
        #     These attributes must NOT contain data that needs to be parsed or processed
        #     further, e.g. JSON or other encodings.
        #
        #     If you provide custom attributes for ingested user events, also include
        #     them in the user events that you associate with prediction requests. Custom
        #     attribute formatting must be consistent between imported events and events
        #     provided with prediction requests. This lets the Discovery Engine API use
        #     those custom attributes when training models and serving predictions, which
        #     helps improve recommendation quality.
        #
        #     This field needs to pass all below criteria, otherwise an
        #     `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned:
        #
        #     * The key must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 5,000
        #       characters.
        #     * For text attributes, at most 400 values are allowed. Empty values are not
        #       allowed. Each value must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of
        #       256 characters.
        #     * For number attributes, at most 400 values are allowed.
        #
        #     For product recommendations, an example of extra user information is
        #     `traffic_channel`, which is how a user arrives at the site. Users can
        #     arrive
        #     at the site by coming to the site directly, coming through Google
        #     search, or in other ways.
