          # A group is a named filter that is used to identify
          # a collection of monitored resources. Groups are typically used to
          # mirror the physical and/or logical topology of the environment.
          # Because group membership is computed dynamically, monitored
          # resources that are started in the future are automatically placed
          # in matching groups. By using a group to name monitored resources in,
          # for example, an alert policy, the target of that alert policy is
          # updated automatically as monitored resources are added and removed
          # from the infrastructure.
