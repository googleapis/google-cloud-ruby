          # The AlertPolicyService API is used to manage (list, create, delete,
          # edit) alert policies in Cloud Monitoring. An alerting policy is
          # a description of the conditions under which some aspect of your
          # system is considered to be "unhealthy" and the ways to notify
          # people or services about this state. In addition to using this API, alert
          # policies can also be managed through
          # [Cloud Monitoring](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/docs/),
          # which can be reached by clicking the "Monitoring" tab in
          # [Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
