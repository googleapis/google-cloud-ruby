            # Google Cloud Datastore Admin API
            #
            #
            # The Datastore Admin API provides several admin services for Cloud Datastore.
            #
            # -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
            # ## Concepts
            #
            # Project, namespace, kind, and entity as defined in the Google Cloud Datastore
            # API.
            #
            # Operation: An Operation represents work being performed in the background.
            #
            # EntityFilter: Allows specifying a subset of entities in a project. This is
            # specified as a combination of kinds and namespaces (either or both of which
            # may be all).
            #
            # -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
            # ## Services
            #
            # # Export/Import
            #
            # The Export/Import service provides the ability to copy all or a subset of
            # entities to/from Google Cloud Storage.
            #
            # Exported data may be imported into Cloud Datastore for any Google Cloud
            # Platform project. It is not restricted to the export source project. It is
            # possible to export from one project and then import into another.
            #
            # Exported data can also be loaded into Google BigQuery for analysis.
            #
            # Exports and imports are performed asynchronously. An Operation resource is
            # created for each export/import. The state (including any errors encountered)
            # of the export/import may be queried via the Operation resource.
            #
            # # Index
            #
            # The index service manages Cloud Datastore composite indexes.
            #
            # Index creation and deletion are performed asynchronously.
            # An Operation resource is created for each such asynchronous operation.
            # The state of the operation (including any errors encountered)
            # may be queried via the Operation resource.
            #
            # # Operation
            #
            # The Operations collection provides a record of actions performed for the
            # specified project (including any operations in progress). Operations are not
            # created directly but through calls on other collections or resources.
            #
            # An operation that is not yet done may be cancelled. The request to cancel is
            # asynchronous and the operation may continue to run for some time after the
            # request to cancel is made.
            #
            # An operation that is done may be deleted so that it is no longer listed as
            # part of the Operation collection.
            #
            # ListOperations returns all pending operations, but not completed operations.
            #
            # Operations are created by service DatastoreAdmin,
            # but are accessed via service google.longrunning.Operations.
