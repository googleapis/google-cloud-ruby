    ##
    # A class used to wrap the longrunning operation objects, including the nonstandard ones
    # (`nonstandard` meaning not conforming to the AIP-151).
    # It provides helper methods to poll and check for status of these operations.
    #
    class Operation < Gapic::GenericLRO::BaseOperation
      ##
      # @param operation [Object] The long-running operation object that is returned by the initial method call.
      #
      # @param client [Object] The client that handles the polling for the longrunning operation.
      #
      # @param polling_method_name [String] The name of the methods on the client that polls the longrunning operation.
      #
      # @param operation_status_field [String] The name of the `status` field in the underlying long-running operation
      #   object. The `status` field signals that the operation has finished. It should either contain symbols, and
      #   be set to `:DONE` when finished or contain a boolean and be set to `true` when finished.
      #
      # @param request_values [Map<String, String>] The values that are to be copied from the request that
      #   triggered the longrunning operation, into the request that polls for the longrunning operation.
      #   The format is `name of the request field` -> `value`
      #
      # @param operation_name_field [String, nil] The name of the `name` field in the underlying long-running operation
      #   object. Optional.
      #
      # @param operation_err_field [String, nil] The name of the `error` field in the underlying long-running operation
      #   object. The `error` field should be a message-type, and have same semantics as `google.rpc.Status`, including
      #   an integer `code` subfield, that carries an error code. If the `operation_err_field` field is given,
      #   the `operation_err_code_field` and `operation_err_msg_field` parameters are ignored. Optional.
      #
      # @param operation_err_code_field [String, nil] The name of the `error_code` field in the underlying
      #   long-running operation object. It is ignored if `operation_err_field` is given. Optional.
      #
      # @param operation_err_msg_field [String, nil] The name of the `error_message` field in the underlying
      #   long-running operation object. It is ignored if `operation_err_field` is given. Optional.
      #
      # @param operation_copy_fields [Map<String, String>] The map of the fields that need to be copied from the
      #   long-running operation object that the polling method returns to the polling request.
      #   The format is `name of the operation object field` -> `name of the request field` (`from` -> `to`)
      #
      # @param options [Gapic::CallOptions] call options for this operation
