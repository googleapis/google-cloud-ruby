Google API Extensions for Ruby
================================

Generated API Client common code (gapic-common) is a set of modules which aids
the development of APIs for clients and servers based on [gRPC][] and Google API
conventions.

Application code will rarely need to use most of the classes within this library
directly, but code generated automatically from the API definition files in
[Google APIs][] can use services such as page streaming to provide a more
convenient and idiomatic API surface to callers.

## Supported Ruby Versions

This library is supported on Ruby 2.4+.

Google provides official support for Ruby versions that are actively supported

security maintenance, and not end of life. Currently, this means Ruby 2.4 and
later. Older versions of Ruby _may_ still work, but are unsupported and not
recommended. See https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/branches/ for details
about the Ruby support schedule.
