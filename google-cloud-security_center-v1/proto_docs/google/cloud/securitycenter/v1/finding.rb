        # privacy, that is ingested into Security Command Center for presentation,
        # notification, analysis, policy testing, and enforcement. For example, a
        # cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in an App Engine application is a
        # finding.

            # steps or a complex exploit) gain access and the ability to execute
            # arbitrary code or exfiltrate data. An example is a service account with
