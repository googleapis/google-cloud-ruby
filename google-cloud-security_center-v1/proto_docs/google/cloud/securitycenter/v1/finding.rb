        # A finding is a record of assessment data like security, risk, health, or
        # privacy, that is ingested into Security Command Center for presentation,
        # notification, analysis, policy testing, and enforcement. For example, a
        # cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in an App Engine application is a
        # finding.

        #     "organizations/\\{organization_id}/sources/\\{source_id}/findings/\\{finding_id}"
        # @!attribute [rw] parent

        #     This field is immutable after creation time.
        #     For example:
        #     "organizations/\\{organization_id}/sources/\\{source_id}"

            # the ability to execute arbitrary code, exfiltrate data, and otherwise
            # gain additional access and privileges to cloud resources and workloads.

            # resources.

            # steps or a complex exploit) gain access and the ability to execute
            # arbitrary code or exfiltrate data. An example is a service account with
            # access to more projects than it should have. If an actor gains access to
            # the service account, they could potentially use that access to manipulate
            # a project the service account was not intended to.
