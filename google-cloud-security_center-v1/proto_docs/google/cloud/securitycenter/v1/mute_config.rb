        # A mute config is a Cloud SCC resource that contains the configuration
        # to mute create/update events of findings.
        # @!attribute [rw] name
        #   @return [::String]
        #     This field will be ignored if provided on config creation. Format
        #     "organizations/\\{organization}/muteConfigs/\\{mute_config}"
        #     "folders/\\{folder}/muteConfigs/\\{mute_config}"

        # @!attribute [rw] display_name
        #   @return [::String]
        #     The human readable name to be displayed for the mute config.
        # @!attribute [rw] description
        #   @return [::String]
        #     A description of the mute config.
        # @!attribute [rw] filter
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Required. An expression that defines the filter to apply across create/update events
        #     of findings. While creating a filter string, be mindful of the
        #     scope in which the mute configuration is being created. E.g., If a filter
        #     contains project = X but is created under the project = Y scope, it might
        #     not match any findings.
