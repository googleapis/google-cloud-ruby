        # Represents database access information, such as queries.
        # A database may be a sub-resource of an instance (as in the case of CloudSQL
        # instances or Cloud Spanner instances), or the database instance itself.
        # Some database resources may not have the full resource name populated
        # because these resource types are not yet supported by Cloud Asset Inventory
        # (e.g. CloudSQL databases).  In these cases only the display name will be
        # provided.
        # @!attribute [rw] name

        #     The full resource name of the database the user connected to, if it is
        #     supported by CAI. (https://google.aip.dev/122#full-resource-names)
        # @!attribute [rw] display_name
        #   @return [::String]
        #     The human readable name of the database the user connected to.
        # @!attribute [rw] user_name
        #   @return [::String]
        #     The username used to connect to the DB. This may not necessarily be an IAM
        #     principal, and has no required format.
        # @!attribute [rw] query
        #   @return [::String]
        #     The SQL statement associated with the relevant access.

        #   @return [::Array<::String>]
        #     The target usernames/roles/groups of a SQL privilege grant (not an IAM
        #     policy change).
