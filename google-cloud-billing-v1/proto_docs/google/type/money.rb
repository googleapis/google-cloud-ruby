module Google
  module Type
    # Represents an amount of money with its currency type.
    # @!attribute [rw] currency_code
    #   @return [::String]
    #     The three-letter currency code defined in ISO 4217.
    # @!attribute [rw] units
    #   @return [::Integer]
    #     The whole units of the amount.
    #     For example if `currencyCode` is `"USD"`, then 1 unit is one US dollar.
    # @!attribute [rw] nanos
    #   @return [::Integer]
    #     Number of nano (10^-9) units of the amount.
    #     The value must be between -999,999,999 and +999,999,999 inclusive.
    #     If `units` is positive, `nanos` must be positive or zero.
    #     If `units` is zero, `nanos` can be positive, zero, or negative.
    #     If `units` is negative, `nanos` must be negative or zero.
    #     For example $-1.75 is represented as `units`=-1 and `nanos`=-750,000,000.
