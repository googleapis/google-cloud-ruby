# Release History

### 1.0.0 / 2020-05-07

This is a major update over the older google-cloud-webrisk gem, with significant new features, improved documentation, and a fair number of breaking changes.

Among the highlights:

* Separate client libraries are now provided for specific service versions.
* A new configuration mechanism makes it easier to control parameters such as endpoint address, network timeouts, and retry.
* A consistent method interface using keyword arguments for all fields, and supporting request proto objects.
* Helper methods for generating resource paths are more accessible.
* More consistent spelling of module names.

See the MIGRATING file in the documentation for more detailed information, and instructions for migrating from google-cloud-webrisk.
