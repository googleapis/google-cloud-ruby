        # A Job resource represents a job posting (also referred to as a "job listing"
        # or "job requisition"). A job belongs to a {::Google::Cloud::Talent::V4::Company Company}, which is the hiring
        # entity responsible for the job.
        # @!attribute [rw] name
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Required during job update.
        #
        #     The resource name for the job. This is generated by the service when a
        #     job is created.
        #
        #     The format is
        #     "projects/\\{project_id}/tenants/\\{tenant_id}/jobs/\\{job_id}". For
        #     example, "projects/foo/tenants/bar/jobs/baz".
        #
        #     Use of this field in job queries and API calls is preferred over the use of
        #     {::Google::Cloud::Talent::V4::Job#requisition_id requisition_id} since this value is unique.
        # @!attribute [rw] company
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Required. The resource name of the company listing the job.
        #
        #     The format is
        #     "projects/\\{project_id}/tenants/\\{tenant_id}/companies/\\{company_id}". For
        #     example, "projects/foo/tenants/bar/companies/baz".
        # @!attribute [rw] requisition_id
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Required. The requisition ID, also referred to as the posting ID, is assigned by the
        #     client to identify a job. This field is intended to be used by clients
        #     for client identification and tracking of postings. A job isn't allowed
        #     to be created if there is another job with the same {::Google::Cloud::Talent::V4::Job#name company},
        #     {::Google::Cloud::Talent::V4::Job#language_code language_code} and {::Google::Cloud::Talent::V4::Job#requisition_id requisition_id}.
        #
        #     The maximum number of allowed characters is 255.
        # @!attribute [rw] title
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Required. The title of the job, such as "Software Engineer"
        #
        #     The maximum number of allowed characters is 500.
        # @!attribute [rw] description
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Required. The description of the job, which typically includes a multi-paragraph
        #     description of the company and related information. Separate fields are
        #     provided on the job object for {::Google::Cloud::Talent::V4::Job#responsibilities responsibilities},
        #     {::Google::Cloud::Talent::V4::Job#qualifications qualifications}, and other job characteristics. Use of
        #     these separate job fields is recommended.
        #
        #     This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts
        #     bold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags.
        #
        #     The maximum number of allowed characters is 100,000.
        # @!attribute [rw] addresses
        #   @return [::Array<::String>]
        #     Strongly recommended for the best service experience.
        #
        #     Location(s) where the employer is looking to hire for this job posting.
        #
        #     Specifying the full street address(es) of the hiring location enables
        #     better API results, especially job searches by commute time.
        #
        #     At most 50 locations are allowed for best search performance. If a job has
        #     more locations, it is suggested to split it into multiple jobs with unique
        #     {::Google::Cloud::Talent::V4::Job#requisition_id requisition_id}s (e.g. 'ReqA' becomes 'ReqA-1', 'ReqA-2', and so on.) as
        #     multiple jobs with the same {::Google::Cloud::Talent::V4::Job#company company}, {::Google::Cloud::Talent::V4::Job#language_code language_code} and
        #     {::Google::Cloud::Talent::V4::Job#requisition_id requisition_id} are not allowed. If the original {::Google::Cloud::Talent::V4::Job#requisition_id requisition_id} must
        #     be preserved, a custom field should be used for storage. It is also
        #     suggested to group the locations that close to each other in the same job
        #     for better search experience.
        #
        #     Jobs with multiple addresses must have their addresses with the same
        #     [LocationType][] to allow location filtering to work properly. (For
        #     example, a Job with addresses "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View,
        #     CA, USA" and "London, UK" may not have location filters applied correctly
        #     at search time since the first is a [LocationType.STREET_ADDRESS][] and the
        #     second is a [LocationType.LOCALITY][].) If a job needs to have multiple
        #     addresses, it is suggested to split it into multiple jobs with same
        #     LocationTypes.
        #
        #     The maximum number of allowed characters is 500.

        # @!attribute [rw] job_start_time
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Timestamp]
        #     The start timestamp of the job in UTC time zone. Typically this field

        #     The timestamp this job posting was most recently published. The default

        #     Strongly recommended for the best service experience.
        #
        #     The expiration timestamp of the job. After this timestamp, the
        #     job is marked as expired, and it no longer appears in search results. The
        #     expired job can't be listed by the {::Google::Cloud::Talent::V4::JobService::Client#list_jobs ListJobs} API,
        #     but it can be retrieved with the {::Google::Cloud::Talent::V4::JobService::Client#get_job GetJob} API or
        #     updated with the {::Google::Cloud::Talent::V4::JobService::Client#update_job UpdateJob} API or deleted with
        #     the {::Google::Cloud::Talent::V4::JobService::Client#delete_job DeleteJob} API. An expired job can
        #     be updated and opened again by using a future expiration timestamp.
        #     Updating an expired job fails if there is another existing open job with
        #     same {::Google::Cloud::Talent::V4::Job#company company}, {::Google::Cloud::Talent::V4::Job#language_code language_code} and {::Google::Cloud::Talent::V4::Job#requisition_id requisition_id}.
        #
        #     The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the
        #     overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum number of
        #     open jobs over previous 7 days. If this threshold is exceeded,
        #     expired jobs are cleaned out in order of earliest expire time.
        #     Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned
        #     out.
        #
        #     Invalid timestamps are ignored, and treated as expire time not provided.
        #
        #     If the timestamp is before the instant request is made, the job
        #     is treated as expired immediately on creation. This kind of job can
        #     not be updated. And when creating a job with past timestamp, the
        #     {::Google::Cloud::Talent::V4::Job#posting_publish_time posting_publish_time} must be set before
        #     {::Google::Cloud::Talent::V4::Job#posting_expire_time posting_expire_time}. The purpose of this feature is
        #     to allow other objects, such as [Application][], to refer a job
        #     that didn't exist in the system prior to becoming expired. If you
        #     want to modify a job that was expired on creation,
        #     delete it and create a new one.
        #
        #     If this value isn't provided at the time of job creation or is invalid,
        #     the job posting expires after 30 days from the job's creation time. For
        #     example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an
        #     unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC.
        #
        #     If this value isn't provided on job update, it depends on the field masks
        #     set by {::Google::Cloud::Talent::V4::UpdateJobRequest#update_mask UpdateJobRequest.update_mask}. If the field masks include
        #     {::Google::Cloud::Talent::V4::Job#job_end_time job_end_time}, or the masks are empty meaning that every field is
        #     updated, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job's last
        #     update time. Otherwise the expiration date isn't updated.
