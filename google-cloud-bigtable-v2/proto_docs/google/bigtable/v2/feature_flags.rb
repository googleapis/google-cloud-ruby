        # Feature flags supported by a client.
        # This is intended to be sent as part of request metadata to assure the server
        # that certain behaviors are safe to enable. This proto is meant to be
        # serialized and websafe-base64 encoded under the `bigtable-features` metadata
        # key. The value will remain constant for the lifetime of a client and due to
        # HTTP2's HPACK compression, the request overhead will be tiny.
        # This is an internal implementation detail and should not be used by endusers
        # directly.

        #     Notify the server that the client supports reverse scans. The server will
        #     reject ReadRowsRequests with the reverse bit set when this is absent.
        # @!attribute [rw] mutate_rows_rate_limit
        #   @return [::Boolean]
        #     Notify the server that the client enables batch write flow control by
        #     requesting RateLimitInfo from MutateRowsResponse.
