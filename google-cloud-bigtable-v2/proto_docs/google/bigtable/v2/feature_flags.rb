        # Feature flags supported or enabled by a client.
        # This is intended to be sent as part of request metadata to assure the server
        # that certain behaviors are safe to enable. This proto is meant to be
        # serialized and websafe-base64 encoded under the `bigtable-features` metadata
        # key. The value will remain constant for the lifetime of a client and due to
        # HTTP2's HPACK compression, the request overhead will be tiny.
        # This is an internal implementation detail and should not be used by end users
        # directly.
        # @!attribute [rw] reverse_scans
        #   @return [::Boolean]
        #     Notify the server that the client supports reverse scans. The server will
        #     reject ReadRowsRequests with the reverse bit set when this is absent.
        # @!attribute [rw] mutate_rows_rate_limit
        #   @return [::Boolean]
        #     Notify the server that the client enables batch write flow control by
        #     requesting RateLimitInfo from MutateRowsResponse. Due to technical reasons,
        #     this disables partial retries.
        # @!attribute [rw] mutate_rows_rate_limit2
        #   @return [::Boolean]
        #     Notify the server that the client enables batch write flow control by
        #     requesting RateLimitInfo from MutateRowsResponse. With partial retries
        #     enabled.
        # @!attribute [rw] last_scanned_row_responses
        #   @return [::Boolean]
        #     Notify the server that the client supports the last_scanned_row field
        #     in ReadRowsResponse for long-running scans.
