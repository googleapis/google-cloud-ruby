        # Takes a row as input and produces an alternate view of the row based on
        # specified rules. For example, a RowFilter might trim down a row to include
        # just the cells from columns matching a given regular expression, or might
        # return all the cells of a row but not their values. More complicated filters
        # can be composed out of these components to express requests such as, "within
        # every column of a particular family, give just the two most recent cells
        # which are older than timestamp X."
        #
        # There are two broad categories of RowFilters (true filters and transformers),
        # as well as two ways to compose simple filters into more complex ones
        # (chains and interleaves). They work as follows:
        #
        # * True filters alter the input row by excluding some of its cells wholesale
        # from the output row. An example of a true filter is the `value_regex_filter`,
        # which excludes cells whose values don't match the specified pattern. All
        # regex true filters use RE2 syntax (https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax)
        # in raw byte mode (RE2::Latin1), and are evaluated as full matches. An
        # important point to keep in mind is that `RE2(.)` is equivalent by default to
        # `RE2([^\n])`, meaning that it does not match newlines. When attempting to
        # match an arbitrary byte, you should therefore use the escape sequence `\C`,
        # which may need to be further escaped as `\\C` in your client language.
        #
        # * Transformers alter the input row by changing the values of some of its
        # cells in the output, without excluding them completely. Currently, the only
        # supported transformer is the `strip_value_transformer`, which replaces every
        # cell's value with the empty string.
        #
        # * Chains and interleaves are described in more detail in the
        # RowFilter.Chain and RowFilter.Interleave documentation.
        #
        # The total serialized size of a RowFilter message must not
        # exceed 20480 bytes, and RowFilters may not be nested within each other
        # (in Chains or Interleaves) to a depth of more than 20.
        # @!attribute [rw] chain
        #   @return [::Google::Cloud::Bigtable::V2::RowFilter::Chain]
        #     Applies several RowFilters to the data in sequence, progressively
        #     narrowing the results.
        # @!attribute [rw] interleave
        #   @return [::Google::Cloud::Bigtable::V2::RowFilter::Interleave]
        #     Applies several RowFilters to the data in parallel and combines the
        #     results.
        # @!attribute [rw] condition
        #   @return [::Google::Cloud::Bigtable::V2::RowFilter::Condition]

        #     Hook for introspection into the RowFilter. Outputs all cells directly to
        #     the output of the read rather than to any parent filter. Consider the
