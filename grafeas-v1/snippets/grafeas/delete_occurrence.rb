# Snippet for the delete_occurrence call in the Grafeas service
#
# This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code
# template only. It will require modifications to work:
# - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
# - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service
# client as shown in https://cloud.google.com/ruby/docs/reference.
#
# This is an auto-generated example demonstrating basic usage of
# Grafeas::V1::Grafeas::Client#delete_occurrence.
#
def delete_occurrence
  # Create a client object. The client can be reused for multiple calls.
  client = Grafeas::V1::Grafeas::Client.new

  # Create a request. To set request fields, pass in keyword arguments.
  request = Grafeas::V1::DeleteOccurrenceRequest.new

  # Call the delete_occurrence method.
  result = client.delete_occurrence request

  # The returned object is of type Google::Protobuf::Empty.
  p result
