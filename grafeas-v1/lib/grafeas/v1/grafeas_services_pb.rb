      # [Grafeas](https://grafeas.io) API.
      #
      # Retrieves analysis results of Cloud components such as Docker container
      # images.
      #
      # Analysis results are stored as a series of occurrences. An `Occurrence`
      # contains information about a specific analysis instance on a resource. An
      # occurrence refers to a `Note`. A note contains details describing the
      # analysis and is generally stored in a separate project, called a `Provider`.
      # Multiple occurrences can refer to the same note.
      #
      # For example, an SSL vulnerability could affect multiple images. In this case,
      # there would be one note for the vulnerability and an occurrence for each
      # image with the vulnerability referring to that note.
