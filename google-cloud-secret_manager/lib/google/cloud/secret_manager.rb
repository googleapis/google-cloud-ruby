      # Create a new client object for SecretManagerService.
      #
      # By default, this returns an instance of
      # [Google::Cloud::SecretManager::V1::SecretManagerService::Client](https://googleapis.dev/ruby/google-cloud-secret_manager-v1/latest/Google/Cloud/SecretManager/V1/SecretManagerService/Client.html)
      # for version V1 of the API.
      # However, you can specify specify a different API version by passing it in the
      # `version` parameter. If the SecretManagerService service is
      # supported by that API version, and the corresponding gem is available, the
      # appropriate versioned client will be returned.
