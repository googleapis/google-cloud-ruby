            # will treat requests using "default_branch" to the actual branch id set as
            # default.
            #
            # For example, if `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/1` is set as
            # default, setting
            # [SearchRequest.branch][google.cloud.retail.v2.SearchRequest.branch] to
            # `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/default_branch` is equivalent
            # to setting
            # [SearchRequest.branch][google.cloud.retail.v2.SearchRequest.branch] to
            # `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/1`.
            #
            # Using multiple branches can be useful when developers would like
            # to have a staging branch to test and verify for future usage. When it
            # becomes ready, developers switch on the staging branch using this API while
            # keeping using `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/default_branch`
            # as [SearchRequest.branch][google.cloud.retail.v2.SearchRequest.branch] to
            # route the traffic to this staging branch.
            #
            # CAUTION: If you have live predict/search traffic, switching the default
            # branch could potentially cause outages if the ID space of the new branch is
            # very different from the old one.
            #
            # More specifically:
            #
            # * PredictionService will only return product IDs from branch {newBranch}.
            # * SearchService will only return product IDs from branch {newBranch}
            #   (if branch is not explicitly set).
            # * UserEventService will only join events with products from branch
            #   {newBranch}.
