      # By default, this returns an instance of
      # [Google::Cloud::PolicySimulator::V1::Simulator::Client](https://cloud.google.com/ruby/docs/reference/google-cloud-policy_simulator-v1/latest/Google-Cloud-PolicySimulator-V1-Simulator-Client)
      # for a gRPC client for version V1 of the API.
      # However, you can specify a different API version by passing it in the
      # `version` parameter. If the Simulator service is
      # supported by that API version, and the corresponding gem is available, the
      # appropriate versioned client will be returned.
      # You can also specify a different transport by passing `:rest` or `:grpc` in
      # the `transport` parameter.

      # ## About Simulator
      #
      # Policy Simulator API service.
      #
      # Policy Simulator is a collection of endpoints for creating, running, and
      # viewing a Replay. A
      # Replay is a type of simulation that
      # lets you see how your principals' access to resources might change if you
      # changed your IAM policy.
      #
      # During a Replay, Policy Simulator
      # re-evaluates, or replays, past access attempts under both the current policy
      # and  your proposed policy, and compares those results to determine how your
      # principals' access might change under the proposed policy.
      #
      # @param version [::String, ::Symbol] The API version to connect to. Optional.
      #   Defaults to `:v1`.
      # @param transport [:grpc, :rest] The transport to use. Defaults to `:grpc`.
      # @return [::Object] A client object for the specified version.
