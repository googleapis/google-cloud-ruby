# Snippet for the list_hubs call in the HubService service
#
# This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code
# template only. It will require modifications to work:
# - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
# - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service
# client as shown in https://cloud.google.com/ruby/docs/reference.
#
# This is an auto-generated example demonstrating basic usage of
# Google::Cloud::NetworkConnectivity::V1::HubService::Client#list_hubs.
#
def list_hubs
  # Create a client object. The client can be reused for multiple calls.
  client = Google::Cloud::NetworkConnectivity::V1::HubService::Client.new

  # Create a request. To set request fields, pass in keyword arguments.
  request = Google::Cloud::NetworkConnectivity::V1::ListHubsRequest.new

  # Call the list_hubs method.
  result = client.list_hubs request

  # The returned object is of type Gapic::PagedEnumerable. You can iterate
  # over elements, and API calls will be issued to fetch pages as needed.
  result.each do |item|
    # Each element is of type ::Google::Cloud::NetworkConnectivity::V1::Hub.
    p item
