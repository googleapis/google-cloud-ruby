        # An individual endpoint that provides a
        # {::Google::Cloud::ServiceDirectory::V1::Service service}. The service must
        # already exist to create an endpoint.
        # @!attribute [rw] name
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Immutable. The resource name for the endpoint in the format
        #     `projects/*/locations/*/namespaces/*/services/*/endpoints/*`.
        # @!attribute [rw] address
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Optional. An IPv4 or IPv6 address. Service Directory will reject bad
        #     addresses like:
        #       "8.8.8"
        #       "8.8.8.8:53"
        #       "test:bad:address"
        #       "[::1]"
        #       "[::1]:8080"
        #     Limited to 45 characters.
        # @!attribute [rw] port
        #   @return [::Integer]
        #     Optional. Service Directory will reject values outside of [0, 65535].
        # @!attribute [rw] annotations
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Map{::String => ::String}]
        #     Optional. Annotations for the endpoint. This data can be consumed by
        #     service clients. Restrictions:
        #      - The entire annotations dictionary may contain up to 512 characters,
        #        spread accoss all key-value pairs. Annotations that goes beyond any
        #        these limits will be rejected.
        #      - Valid annotation keys have two segments: an optional prefix and name,
        #        separated by a slash (/). The name segment is required and must be 63
        #        characters or less, beginning and ending with an alphanumeric character
        #        ([a-z0-9A-Z]) with dashes (-), underscores (_), dots (.), and
        #        alphanumerics between. The prefix is optional. If specified, the prefix
        #        must be a DNS subdomain: a series of DNS labels separated by dots (.),
        #        not longer than 253 characters in total, followed by a slash (/).
        #        Annotations that fails to meet these requirements will be rejected.
        #      - The '(*.)google.com/' and '(*.)googleapis.com/' prefixes are reserved
        #        for system annotations managed by Service Directory. If the user tries
        #        to write to these keyspaces, those entries will be silently ignored by
        #        the system.
        #     Note: This field is equivalent to the 'metadata' field in the v1beta1 API.
        #     They have the same syntax and read/write to the same location in Service
        #     Directory.
