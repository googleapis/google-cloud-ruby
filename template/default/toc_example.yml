  # Just a flatly organized list of all the library's classes/modules that
  # got their own yml files. It is currently kept flat (vs hierarchical like yard default)
  # due to the width limit of the html toc not indenting for deeper sections of
  # the object tree, and because currently drop-down entries can't themselves be a page, so
  # for example the Google::Cloud::Vision::V1 drop down would have to have itself as one of
  # its entries
