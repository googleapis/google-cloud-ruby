        # By default, this returns an instance of
        # [Google::Cloud::Firestore::Admin::V1::FirestoreAdmin::Client](https://googleapis.dev/ruby/google-cloud-firestore-admin-v1/latest/Google/Cloud/Firestore/Admin/V1/FirestoreAdmin/Client.html)
        # for a gRPC client for version V1 of the API.
        # However, you can specify a different API version by passing it in the
        # `version` parameter. If the FirestoreAdmin service is
        # supported by that API version, and the corresponding gem is available, the
        # appropriate versioned client will be returned.
        #
        # ## About FirestoreAdmin
        #
        # The Cloud Firestore Admin API.
        #
        # This API provides several administrative services for Cloud Firestore.
        #
        # Project, Database, Namespace, Collection, Collection Group, and Document are
        # used as defined in the Google Cloud Firestore API.
        #
        # Operation: An Operation represents work being performed in the background.
        #
        # The index service manages Cloud Firestore indexes.
        #
        # Index creation is performed asynchronously.
        # An Operation resource is created for each such asynchronous operation.
        # The state of the operation (including any errors encountered)
        # may be queried via the Operation resource.
        #
        # The Operations collection provides a record of actions performed for the
        # specified Project (including any Operations in progress). Operations are not
        # created directly but through calls on other collections or resources.
        #
        # An Operation that is done may be deleted so that it is no longer listed as
        # part of the Operation collection. Operations are garbage collected after
        # 30 days. By default, ListOperations will only return in progress and failed
        # operations. To list completed operation, issue a ListOperations request with
        # the filter `done: true`.
        #
        # Operations are created by service `FirestoreAdmin`, but are accessed via
        # service `google.longrunning.Operations`.
        #
        # @param version [::String, ::Symbol] The API version to connect to. Optional.
        #   Defaults to `:v1`.
        # @return [::Object] A client object for the specified version.
