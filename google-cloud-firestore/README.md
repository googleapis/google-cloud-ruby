# Ruby Client for Google Cloud Firestore API

[Google Cloud Firestore API][Product Documentation]:

- [Client Library Documentation][]
- [Product Documentation][]

## Quick Start
In order to use this library, you first need to go through the following
steps:

1. [Select or create a Cloud Platform project.](https://console.cloud.google.com/project)
2. [Enable the Google Cloud Firestore API.](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/firestore)
3. [Setup Authentication.](https://googleapis.dev/ruby/google-cloud-firestore/latest/file.AUTHENTICATION.html)

### Installation
```
$ gem install google-cloud-firestore
```

### Next Steps
- Read the [Client Library Documentation][] for Google Cloud Firestore API
  to see other available methods on the client.
- Read the [Google Cloud Firestore API Product documentation][Product Documentation]
  to learn more about the product and see How-to Guides.
- View this [repository's main README](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-ruby/blob/master/README.md)
  to see the full list of Cloud APIs that we cover.

## Example

```ruby
require "google/cloud/firestore"

firestore = Google::Cloud::Firestore.new(
  project_id: "my-project",
  credentials: "/path/to/keyfile.json"
)

city = firestore.col("cities").doc("SF")
city.set({ name: "San Francisco",
           state: "CA",
           country: "USA",
           capital: false,
           population: 860000 })

firestore.transaction do |tx|
  new_population = tx.get(city).data[:population] + 1
  tx.update(city, { population: new_population })
end
```

## Enabling Logging

To enable logging for this library, set the logger for the underlying [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/tree/master/src/ruby) library. The logger that you set may be a Ruby stdlib [`Logger`](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/logger/rdoc/Logger.html) as shown below, or a [`Google::Cloud::Logging::Logger`](https://googleapis.dev/ruby/google-cloud-logging/latest) that will write logs to [Stackdriver Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging/). See [grpc/logconfig.rb](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/ruby/lib/grpc/logconfig.rb) and the gRPC [spec_helper.rb](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/ruby/spec/spec_helper.rb) for additional information.

Configuring a Ruby stdlib logger:

```ruby
require "logger"

module MyLogger
  LOGGER = Logger.new $stderr, level: Logger::WARN
  def logger
    LOGGER
  end
end

# Define a gRPC module-level logger method before grpc/logconfig.rb loads.
module GRPC
  extend MyLogger
end
```

## Supported Ruby Versions

This library is supported on Ruby 2.6+.

Google provides official support for Ruby versions that are actively supported
by Ruby Coreâ€”that is, Ruby versions that are either in normal maintenance or
in security maintenance, and not end of life. Older versions of Ruby _may_
still work, but are unsupported and not recommended. See
https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/branches/ for details about the Ruby
support schedule.
