        # ## About Publisher
        #
        # Eventarc processes events generated by an event provider and delivers them to
        # a subscriber.
        #
        # An event provider is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) system or
        # product that can generate and deliver events through Eventarc.
        #
        # A third-party event provider is an event provider from outside of Google.
        #
        # A partner is a third-party event provider that is integrated with Eventarc.
        #
        # A subscriber is a GCP customer interested in receiving events.
        #
        # Channel is a first-class Eventarc resource that is created and managed
        # by the subscriber in their GCP project. A Channel represents a subscriber's
        # intent to receive events from an event provider. A Channel is associated with
        # exactly one event provider.
        #
        # ChannelConnection is a first-class Eventarc resource that
        # is created and managed by the partner in their GCP project. A
        # ChannelConnection represents a connection between a partner and a
        # subscriber's Channel. A ChannelConnection has a one-to-one mapping with a
        # Channel.
        #
        # Publisher allows an event provider to publish events to Eventarc.
        #
        # @param version [::String, ::Symbol] The API version to connect to. Optional.
        #   Defaults to `:v1`.
        # @return [Publisher::Client] A client object for the specified version.
