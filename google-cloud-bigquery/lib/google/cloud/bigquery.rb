    # Google BigQuery enables super-fast, SQL-like queries against massive

    #
    # See {file:OVERVIEW.md BigQuery Overview}.
    #
    module Bigquery
      # Creates a new `Project` instance connected to the BigQuery service.
      # Each call creates a new connection.
      #
      # For more information on connecting to Google Cloud see the
      # {file:AUTHENTICATION.md Authentication Guide}.
      #
      # @param [String] project_id Identifier for a BigQuery project. If not
      #   present, the default project for the credentials is used.
      # @param [String, Hash, Google::Auth::Credentials] credentials The path to
      #   the keyfile as a String, the contents of the keyfile as a Hash, or a
      #   Google::Auth::Credentials object. (See {Bigquery::Credentials})
      # @param [String, Array<String>] scope The OAuth 2.0 scopes controlling
      #   the set of resources and operations that the connection can access.
      #   See # [Using OAuth 2.0 to Access Google #
      #   APIs](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2).

      #   error. The default value is `5`. Optional.
      # @param [Integer] timeout Default timeout to use in requests. Optional.
      # @param [String] endpoint Override of the endpoint host name. Optional.
      #   If the param is nil, uses the default endpoint.
      # @param [String] project Alias for the `project_id` argument. Deprecated.
