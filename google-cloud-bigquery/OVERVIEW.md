# Google Cloud BigQuery

Google BigQuery enables super-fast, SQL-like queries against massive datasets,
using the processing power of Google's infrastructure. To learn more, read [What
is BigQuery?](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/what-is-bigquery).

The goal of google-cloud is to provide an API that is comfortable to Rubyists.
Your authentication credentials are detected automatically in Google Cloud
Platform (GCP), including Google Compute Engine (GCE), Google Kubernetes Engine
(GKE), Google App Engine (GAE), Google Cloud Functions (GCF) and Cloud Run. In
other environments you can configure authentication easily, either directly in
your code or via environment variables. Read more about the options for
connecting in the {file:AUTHENTICATION.md Authentication Guide}.

To help you get started quickly, the first few examples below use a public
dataset provided by Google. As soon as you have [signed
up](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/sign-up) to use BigQuery, and provided
that you stay in the free tier for queries, you should be able to run these
first examples without the need to set up billing or to load data (although
we'll show you how to do that too.)

## Listing Datasets and Tables

A BigQuery project contains datasets, which in turn contain tables. Assuming
that you have not yet created datasets or tables in your own project, let's
connect to Google's `bigquery-public-data` project, and see what we find.

```ruby
require "google/cloud/bigquery"

bigquery = Google::Cloud::Bigquery.new project: "bigquery-public-data"

bigquery.datasets.count #=> 1
bigquery.datasets.first.dataset_id #=> "samples"

dataset = bigquery.datasets.first
tables = dataset.tables

tables.count #=> 7
tables.map &:table_id #=> [..., "shakespeare", "trigrams", "wikipedia"]
```

In addition to listing all datasets and tables in the project, you can also
retrieve individual datasets and tables by ID. Let's look at the structure of
the `shakespeare` table, which contains an entry for every word in every play
written by Shakespeare.

```ruby
require "google/cloud/bigquery"

bigquery = Google::Cloud::Bigquery.new project: "bigquery-public-data"

dataset = bigquery.dataset "samples"
table = dataset.table "shakespeare"

table.headers #=> [:word, :word_count, :corpus, :corpus_date]
table.rows_count #=> 164656
```

Now that you know the column names for the Shakespeare table, let's write and
run a few queries against it.

## Running queries

BigQuery supports two SQL dialects: [standard
SQL](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/) and the
older [legacy SQl (BigQuery
SQL)](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/legacy-sql), as discussed
in the guide [Migrating from legacy
SQL](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/migrating-from-legacy-sql).

### Standard SQL

Standard SQL is the preferred SQL dialect for querying data stored in BigQuery.
It is compliant with the SQL 2011 standard, and has extensions that support
querying nested and repeated data. This is the default syntax. It has several
advantages over legacy SQL, including:

* Composability using `WITH` clauses and SQL functions
* Subqueries in the `SELECT` list and `WHERE` clause
* Correlated subqueries
* `ARRAY` and `STRUCT` data types
* Inserts, updates, and deletes
* `COUNT(DISTINCT <expr>)` is exact and scalable, providing the accuracy of
  `EXACT_COUNT_DISTINCT` without its limitations
* Automatic predicate push-down through `JOIN`s
* Complex `JOIN` predicates, including arbitrary expressions

For examples that demonstrate some of these features, see [Standard SQL
ghlights](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/migrating-from-legacy-sql#standard_sql_highlights).

As shown in this example, standard SQL is the library default:

```ruby
require "google/cloud/bigquery"

bigquery = Google::Cloud::Bigquery.new

sql = "SELECT word, SUM(word_count) AS word_count " \
      "FROM `bigquery-public-data.samples.shakespeare`" \
      "WHERE word IN ('me', 'I', 'you') GROUP BY word"
data = bigquery.query sql
```

Notice that in standard SQL, a fully-qualified table name uses the following
format: <code>`my-dashed-project.dataset1.tableName`</code>.

### Legacy SQL (formerly BigQuery SQL)

Before version 2.0, BigQuery executed queries using a non-standard SQL dialect
known as BigQuery SQL. This variant is optional, and can be enabled by passing
the flag `legacy_sql: true` with your query. (If you get an SQL syntax error
with a query that may be written in legacy SQL, be sure that you are passing
this option.)

To use legacy SQL, pass the option `legacy_sql: true` with your query:

```ruby
require "google/cloud/bigquery"

bigquery = Google::Cloud::Bigquery.new

sql = "SELECT TOP(word, 50) as word, COUNT(*) as count " \
      "FROM [bigquery-public-data:samples.shakespeare]"
data = bigquery.query sql, legacy_sql: true
```

Notice that in legacy SQL, a fully-qualified table name uses brackets instead of
back-ticks, and a colon instead of a dot to separate the project and the
dataset: `[my-dashed-project:dataset1.tableName]`.

#### Query parameters

With standard SQL, you can use positional or named query parameters. This
example shows the use of named parameters:

```ruby
require "google/cloud/bigquery"

bigquery = Google::Cloud::Bigquery.new

sql = "SELECT word, SUM(word_count) AS word_count " \
      "FROM `bigquery-public-data.samples.shakespeare`" \
      "WHERE word IN UNNEST(@words) GROUP BY word"
data = bigquery.query sql, params: { words: ['me', 'I', 'you'] }
```

As demonstrated above, passing the `params` option will automatically set
`standard_sql` to `true`.

#### Data types

BigQuery standard SQL supports simple data types such as integers, as well as
more complex types such as `ARRAY` and `STRUCT`.

The BigQuery data types are converted to and from Ruby types as follows:

| BigQuery     | Ruby                                 | Notes                                                        |
|------------- |--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `BOOL`       | `true`/`false`                       |                                                              |
| `INT64`      | `Integer`                            |                                                              |
| `FLOAT64`    | `Float`                              |                                                              |
| `NUMERIC`    | `BigDecimal`                         | `BigDecimal` values will be rounded to scale 9.              |
| `BIGNUMERIC` | converted to `BigDecimal`            | Pass data as `String` and map query param values in `types`. |
| `STRING`     | `String`                             |                                                              |
| `DATETIME`   | `DateTime`                           | `DATETIME` does not support time zone.                       |
| `DATE`       | `Date`                               |                                                              |
| `TIMESTAMP`  | `Time`                               |                                                              |
| `TIME`       | `Google::Cloud::BigQuery::Time`      |                                                              |
| `BYTES`      | `File`, `IO`, `StringIO`, or similar |                                                              |
| `ARRAY`      | `Array`                              | Nested arrays, `nil` values are not supported.               |
| `STRUCT`     | `Hash`                               | Hash keys may be strings or symbols.                         |

See [Data
Types](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-types)
for an overview of each BigQuery data type, including allowed values.

### Running Queries

Let's start with the simplest way to run a query. Notice that this time you are
connecting using your own default project. It is necessary to have write access
to the project for running a query, since queries need to create tables to hold
results.

```ruby
require "google/cloud/bigquery"

bigquery = Google::Cloud::Bigquery.new

sql = "SELECT APPROX_TOP_COUNT(corpus, 10) as title, " \
      "COUNT(*) as unique_words " \
      "FROM `bigquery-public-data.samples.shakespeare`"
data = bigquery.query sql

data.next? #=> false
data.first #=> {:title=>[{:value=>"hamlet", :count=>5318}, ...}
```

The `APPROX_TOP_COUNT` function shown above is just one of a variety of
functions offered by BigQuery. See the [Query Reference (standard
SQL)](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/functions-and-operators)
for a full listing.

### Query Jobs

It is usually best not to block for most BigQuery operations, including querying
as well as importing, exporting, and copying data. Therefore, the BigQuery API
provides facilities for managing longer-running jobs. With this approach, an
instance of {Google::Cloud::Bigquery::QueryJob} is returned, rather than an
instance of {Google::Cloud::Bigquery::Data}.

```ruby
require "google/cloud/bigquery"

bigquery = Google::Cloud::Bigquery.new

sql = "SELECT APPROX_TOP_COUNT(corpus, 10) as title, " \
      "COUNT(*) as unique_words " \
      "FROM `bigquery-public-data.samples.shakespeare`"
job = bigquery.query_job sql

job.wait_until_done!
if !job.failed?
  job.data.first
  #=> {:title=>[{:value=>"hamlet", :count=>5318}, ...}
end
```

Once you have determined that the job is done and has not failed, you can obtain
an instance of {Google::Cloud::Bigquery::Data} by calling `data` on the job
instance. The query results for both of the above examples are stored in
temporary tables with a lifetime of about 24 hours. See the final example below
for a demonstration of how to store query results in a permanent table.

## Creating Datasets and Tables

The first thing you need to do in a new BigQuery project is to create a
{Google::Cloud::Bigquery::Dataset}. Datasets hold tables and control access to
them.

```ruby
require "google/cloud/bigquery"

bigquery = Google::Cloud::Bigquery.new

dataset = bigquery.create_dataset "my_dataset"
```

Now that you have a dataset, you can use it to create a table. Every table is
defined by a schema that may contain nested and repeated fields. The example
below shows a schema with a repeated record field named `cities_lived`. (For
more information about nested and repeated fields, see [Preparing Data for
Loading](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/preparing-data-for-loading).)

```ruby
require "google/cloud/bigquery"

bigquery = Google::Cloud::Bigquery.new
dataset = bigquery.dataset "my_dataset"

table = dataset.create_table "people" do |schema|
  schema.string "first_name", mode: :required
  schema.record "cities_lived", mode: :repeated do |nested_schema|
    nested_schema.string "place", mode: :required
    nested_schema.integer "number_of_years", mode: :required
  end
end
```

Because of the repeated field in this schema, we cannot use the CSV format to
load data into the table.

## Loading records

To follow along with these examples, you will need to set up billing on the
[Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com).

In addition to CSV, data can be imported from files that are formatted as
[Newline-delimited JSON](https://jsonlines.org/),
[Avro](http://avro.apache.org/),
[ORC](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/loading-data-cloud-storage-orc),
[Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) or from a Google Cloud Datastore backup.
It can also be "streamed" into BigQuery.

### Streaming records

For situations in which you want new data to be available for querying as soon
as possible, inserting individual records directly from your Ruby application is
a great approach.

```ruby
require "google/cloud/bigquery"

bigquery = Google::Cloud::Bigquery.new
dataset = bigquery.dataset "my_dataset"
table = dataset.table "people"

rows = [
    {
        "first_name" => "Anna",
        "cities_lived" => [
            {
                "place" => "Stockholm",
                "number_of_years" => 2
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "first_name" => "Bob",
        "cities_lived" => [
            {
                "place" => "Seattle",
                "number_of_years" => 5
            },
            {
                "place" => "Austin",
                "number_of_years" => 6
            }
        ]
    }
]
table.insert rows
```

To avoid making RPCs (network requests) to retrieve the dataset and table
resources when streaming records, pass the `skip_lookup` option. This creates
local objects without verifying that the resources exist on the BigQuery
service.

```ruby
require "google/cloud/bigquery"

bigquery = Google::Cloud::Bigquery.new
dataset = bigquery.dataset "my_dataset", skip_lookup: true
table = dataset.table "people", skip_lookup: true

rows = [
    {
        "first_name" => "Anna",
        "cities_lived" => [
            {
                "place" => "Stockholm",
                "number_of_years" => 2
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "first_name" => "Bob",
        "cities_lived" => [
            {
                "place" => "Seattle",
                "number_of_years" => 5
            },
            {
                "place" => "Austin",
                "number_of_years" => 6
            }
        ]
    }
]
table.insert rows
```

There are some trade-offs involved with streaming, so be sure to read the
discussion of data consistency in [Streaming Data Into
BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/streaming-data-into-bigquery).

### Uploading a file

To follow along with this example, please download the
[names.zip](http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/names.zip) archive from the U.S.
Social Security Administration. Inside the archive you will find over 100 files
containing baby name records since the year 1880.

```ruby
require "google/cloud/bigquery"

bigquery = Google::Cloud::Bigquery.new
dataset = bigquery.dataset "my_dataset"
table = dataset.create_table "baby_names" do |schema|
  schema.string "name", mode: :required
  schema.string "gender", mode: :required
  schema.integer "count", mode: :required
end

file = File.open "names/yob2014.txt"
table.load file, format: "csv"
```

Because the names data, although formatted as CSV, is distributed in files with
a `.txt` extension, this example explicitly passes the `format` option in order
to demonstrate how to handle such situations. Because CSV is the default format
for load operations, the option is not actually necessary. For JSON saved with a
`.txt` extension, however, it would be.

## Exporting query results to Google Cloud Storage

The example below shows how to pass the `table` option with a query in order to
store results in a permanent table. It also shows how to export the result data
to a Google Cloud Storage file. In order to follow along, you will need to
enable the Google Cloud Storage API in addition to setting up billing.

```ruby
require "google/cloud/bigquery"

bigquery = Google::Cloud::Bigquery.new
dataset = bigquery.dataset "my_dataset"
source_table = dataset.table "baby_names"
result_table = dataset.create_table "baby_names_results"

sql = "SELECT name, count " \
      "FROM baby_names " \
      "WHERE gender = 'M' " \
      "ORDER BY count ASC LIMIT 5"
query_job = dataset.query_job sql, table: result_table

query_job.wait_until_done!

if !query_job.failed?
  require "google/cloud/storage"

  storage = Google::Cloud::Storage.new
  bucket_id = "bigquery-exports-#{SecureRandom.uuid}"
  bucket = storage.create_bucket bucket_id
  extract_url = "gs://#{bucket.id}/baby-names.csv"

  result_table.extract extract_url

  # Download to local filesystem
  bucket.files.first.download "baby-names.csv"
end
```

If a table you wish to export contains a large amount of data, you can pass a
wildcard URI to export to multiple files (for sharding), or an array of URIs
(for partitioning), or both. See [Exporting
Data](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/exporting-data) for details.

## Configuring retries and timeout

You can configure how many times API requests may be automatically retried. When
an API request fails, the response will be inspected to see if the request meets
criteria indicating that it may succeed on retry, such as `500` and `503` status
codes or a specific internal error code such as `rateLimitExceeded`. If it meets
the criteria, the request will be retried after a delay. If another error
occurs, the delay will be increased before a subsequent attempt, until the
`retries` limit is reached.

You can also set the request `timeout` value in seconds.

```ruby
require "google/cloud/bigquery"

bigquery = Google::Cloud::Bigquery.new retries: 10, timeout: 120
```

See the [BigQuery error
table](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/troubleshooting-errors#errortable) for
a list of error conditions.

## Additional information

Google BigQuery can be configured to use logging. To learn more, see the
{file:LOGGING.md Logging guide}.
