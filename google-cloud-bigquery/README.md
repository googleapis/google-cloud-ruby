# google-cloud-bigquery

[Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/) ([docs](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs)) enables super-fast, SQL-like queries against append-only tables, using the processing power of Google's infrastructure. Simply move your data into BigQuery and let it handle the hard work. You can control access to both the project and your data based on your business needs, such as giving others the ability to view or query your data.

## Quick Start

```sh
$ gem install google-cloud-bigquery
```

## Authentication

This library uses Service Account credentials to connect to Google Cloud services. When running on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), including Google Compute Engine (GCE), Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Google App Engine (GAE), Google Cloud Functions (GCF) and Cloud Run, the credentials will be discovered automatically. When running on other environments the Service Account credentials can be specified by providing the path to the JSON file, or the JSON itself, in environment variables.

Instructions and configuration options are covered in the [Authentication Guide](https://googleapis.dev/ruby/google-cloud-bigquery/latest/file.AUTHENTICATION.html).

## Example

```ruby
require "google/cloud/bigquery"

bigquery = Google::Cloud::Bigquery.new
dataset = bigquery.create_dataset "my_dataset"

table = dataset.create_table "my_table" do |t|
  t.name = "My Table"
  t.description = "A description of my table."
  t.schema do |s|
    s.string "first_name", mode: :required
    s.string "last_name", mode: :required
    s.integer "age", mode: :required
  end
end

# Load data into the table from Google Cloud Storage
table.load "gs://my-bucket/file-name.csv"

# Run a query
data = dataset.query "SELECT first_name FROM my_table"

# Iterate over the first page of results
data.each do |row|
  puts row[:first_name]
end
# Retrieve the next page of results
data = data.next if data.next?
```

## Enabling Logging

To enable logging for this library, set the logger for the underlying [Google API Client](https://github.com/google/google-api-ruby-client/blob/master/README.md#logging) library. The logger that you set may be a Ruby stdlib [`Logger`](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/logger/rdoc/Logger.html) as shown below, or a [`Google::Cloud::Logging::Logger`](https://googleapis.dev/ruby/google-cloud-logging/latest) that will write logs to [Stackdriver Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging/).

If you do not set the logger explicitly and your application is running in a Rails environment, it will default to `Rails.logger`. Otherwise, if you do not set the logger and you are not using Rails, logging is disabled by default.

Configuring a Ruby stdlib logger:

```ruby
require "logger"

my_logger = Logger.new $stderr
my_logger.level = Logger::WARN

# Set the Google API Client logger
Google::Apis.logger = my_logger
```

## Supported Ruby Versions

This library is supported on Ruby 2.6+.

Google provides official support for Ruby versions that are actively supported
by Ruby Coreâ€”that is, Ruby versions that are either in normal maintenance or
in security maintenance, and not end of life. Older versions of Ruby _may_
still work, but are unsupported and not recommended. See
https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/branches/ for details about the Ruby
support schedule.

## Versioning

This library follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

It is currently in major version zero (0.y.z), which means that anything may
change at any time and the public API should not be considered stable.
