        #     Required. Your unique identifier for the CSS Product. This is the same for
        #     the CSS Product input and processed CSS Product. We only allow ids with
        #     alphanumerics, underscores and dashes. See the [products feed
        #     specification](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/188494#id) for

        #     Required. The two-letter [ISO

        #     for the CSS Product.

        #
        #     This field must not be set to the future time.
        #

        #     exists in our system (that is the last update time of the existing
        #     CSS products is later than the freshness time set in the update). If

        #     time.

        #     If not set, the update will not be prevented and the last update time will
        #     default to when this request was received by the CSS API.
