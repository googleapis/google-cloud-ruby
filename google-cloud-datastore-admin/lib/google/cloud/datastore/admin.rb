        # By default, this returns an instance of
        # [Google::Cloud::Datastore::Admin::V1::DatastoreAdmin::Client](https://cloud.google.com/ruby/docs/reference/google-cloud-datastore-admin-v1/latest/Google-Cloud-Datastore-Admin-V1-DatastoreAdmin-Client)
        # for a gRPC client for version V1 of the API.
        # However, you can specify a different API version by passing it in the
        # `version` parameter. If the DatastoreAdmin service is
        # supported by that API version, and the corresponding gem is available, the
        # appropriate versioned client will be returned.
        # You can also specify a different transport by passing `:rest` or `:grpc` in
        # the `transport` parameter.

        # ## About DatastoreAdmin
        #
        # Google Cloud Datastore Admin API
        #
        # The Datastore Admin API provides several admin services for Cloud Datastore.
        #
        # Concepts: Project, namespace, kind, and entity as defined in the Google Cloud
        # Datastore API.
        #
        # Operation: An Operation represents work being performed in the background.
        #
        # EntityFilter: Allows specifying a subset of entities in a project. This is
        # specified as a combination of kinds and namespaces (either or both of which
        # may be all).
        #
        # Export/Import Service:
        #
        # - The Export/Import service provides the ability to copy all or a subset of
        # entities to/from Google Cloud Storage.
        # - Exported data may be imported into Cloud Datastore for any Google Cloud
        # Platform project. It is not restricted to the export source project. It is
        # possible to export from one project and then import into another.
        # - Exported data can also be loaded into Google BigQuery for analysis.
        # - Exports and imports are performed asynchronously. An Operation resource is
        # created for each export/import. The state (including any errors encountered)
        # of the export/import may be queried via the Operation resource.
        #
        # Index Service:
        #
        # - The index service manages Cloud Datastore composite indexes.
        # - Index creation and deletion are performed asynchronously.
        # An Operation resource is created for each such asynchronous operation.
        # The state of the operation (including any errors encountered)
        # may be queried via the Operation resource.
        #
        # Operation Service:
        #
        # - The Operations collection provides a record of actions performed for the
        # specified project (including any operations in progress). Operations are not
        # created directly but through calls on other collections or resources.
        # - An operation that is not yet done may be cancelled. The request to cancel
        # is asynchronous and the operation may continue to run for some time after the
        # request to cancel is made.
        # - An operation that is done may be deleted so that it is no longer listed as
        # part of the Operation collection.
        # - ListOperations returns all pending operations, but not completed
        # operations.
        # - Operations are created by service DatastoreAdmin, but are accessed via
        # service google.longrunning.Operations.
        #
        # @param version [::String, ::Symbol] The API version to connect to. Optional.
        #   Defaults to `:v1`.
        # @param transport [:grpc, :rest] The transport to use. Defaults to `:grpc`.
        # @return [::Object] A client object for the specified version.

        # * `lib_name` (*type:* `String`) -
        #   The library name as recorded in instrumentation and logging.
        # * `lib_version` (*type:* `String`) -
        #   The library version as recorded in instrumentation and logging.
        # * `interceptors` (*type:* `Array<GRPC::ClientInterceptor>`) -
