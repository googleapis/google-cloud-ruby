      #
      # ## About Contexts
      #
      # A context represents additional information included with user input or with
      # an intent returned by the Dialogflow API. Contexts are helpful for
      # differentiating user input which may be vague or have a different meaning
      # depending on additional details from your application such as user setting
      # and preferences, previous user input, where the user is in your application,
      # geographic location, and so on.
      #
      # You can include contexts as input parameters of a
      # DetectIntent (or
      # StreamingDetectIntent) request,
      # or as output contexts included in the returned intent.
      # Contexts expire when an intent is matched, after the number of `DetectIntent`
      # requests specified by the `lifespan_count` parameter, or after 20 minutes
      # if no intents are matched for a `DetectIntent` request.
      #
      # For more information about contexts, see the
      # [Dialogflow
      # documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/contexts-overview).

      # appropriate versioned client will be returned.
      #
      # ## About EntityTypes
      #
      # Entities are extracted from user input and represent parameters that are
      # meaningful to your application. For example, a date range, a proper name
      # such as a geographic location or landmark, and so on. Entities represent
      # actionable data for your application.
      #
      # When you define an entity, you can also include synonyms that all map to
      # that entity. For example, "soft drink", "soda", "pop", and so on.
      #
      # There are three types of entities:
      #
      # *   **System** - entities that are defined by the Dialogflow API for common
      #     data types such as date, time, currency, and so on. A system entity is
      #     represented by the `EntityType` type.
      #
      # *   **Custom** - entities that are defined by you that represent
      #     actionable data that is meaningful to your application. For example,
      #     you could define a `pizza.sauce` entity for red or white pizza sauce,
      #     a `pizza.cheese` entity for the different types of cheese on a pizza,
      #     a `pizza.topping` entity for different toppings, and so on. A custom
      #     entity is represented by the `EntityType` type.
      #
      # *   **User** - entities that are built for an individual user such as
      #     favorites, preferences, playlists, and so on. A user entity is
      #     represented by the SessionEntityType type.
      #
      # For more information about entity types, see the
      # [Dialogflow
      # documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/entities-overview).

      # appropriate versioned client will be returned.
      #
      # ## About Intents
      #
      # An intent represents a mapping between input from a user and an action to
      # be taken by your application. When you pass user input to the
      # DetectIntent (or
      # StreamingDetectIntent) method, the
      # Dialogflow API analyzes the input and searches
      # for a matching intent. If no match is found, the Dialogflow API returns a
      # fallback intent (`is_fallback` = true).
      #
      # You can provide additional information for the Dialogflow API to use to
      # match user input to an intent by adding the following to your intent.
      #
      # *   **Contexts** - provide additional context for intent analysis. For
      #     example, if an intent is related to an object in your application that
      #     plays music, you can provide a context to determine when to match the
      #     intent if the user input is "turn it off". You can include a context
      #     that matches the intent when there is previous user input of
      #     "play music", and not when there is previous user input of
      #     "turn on the light".
      #
      # *   **Events** - allow for matching an intent by using an event name
      #     instead of user input. Your application can provide an event name and
      #     related parameters to the Dialogflow API to match an intent. For
      #     example, when your application starts, you can send a welcome event
      #     with a user name parameter to the Dialogflow API to match an intent with
      #     a personalized welcome message for the user.
      #
      # *   **Training phrases** - provide examples of user input to train the
      #     Dialogflow API agent to better match intents.
      #
      # For more information about intents, see the
      # [Dialogflow
      # documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/intents-overview).
