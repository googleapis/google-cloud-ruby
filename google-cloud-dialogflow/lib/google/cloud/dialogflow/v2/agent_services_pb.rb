          # Agents are best described as Natural Language Understanding (NLU) modules
          # that transform user requests into actionable data. You can include agents
          # in your app, product, or service to determine user intent and respond to the
          # user in a natural way.
          #
          # After you create an agent, you can add [Intents][google.cloud.dialogflow.v2.Intents], [Contexts][google.cloud.dialogflow.v2.Contexts],
          # [Entity Types][google.cloud.dialogflow.v2.EntityTypes], [Webhooks][google.cloud.dialogflow.v2.WebhookRequest], and so on to
          # manage the flow of a conversation and match user input to predefined intents
          # and actions.
          #
          # You can create an agent using both Dialogflow Standard Edition and
          # Dialogflow Enterprise Edition. For details, see
          # [Dialogflow Editions](/dialogflow-enterprise/docs/editions).
          #
          # You can save your agent for backup or versioning by exporting the agent by
          # using the [ExportAgent][google.cloud.dialogflow.v2.Agents.ExportAgent] method. You can import a saved
          # agent by using the [ImportAgent][google.cloud.dialogflow.v2.Agents.ImportAgent] method.
          #
          # Dialogflow provides several
          # [prebuilt agents](https://dialogflow.com/docs/prebuilt-agents) for common
          # conversation scenarios such as determining a date and time, converting
          # currency, and so on.
          #
          # For more information about agents, see the
          # [Dialogflow documentation](https://dialogflow.com/docs/agents).
