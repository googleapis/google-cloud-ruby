      # ## About IAMPolicy
      #
      # ## API Overview
      #
      # Manages Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies.
      #
      # Any implementation of an API that offers access control features
      # implements the google.iam.v1.IAMPolicy interface.
      #
      # ## Data model
      #
      # Access control is applied when a principal (user or service account), takes
      # some action on a resource exposed by a service. Resources, identified by
      # URI-like names, are the unit of access control specification. Service
      # implementations can choose the granularity of access control and the
      # supported permissions for their resources.
      # For example one database service may allow access control to be
      # specified only at the Table level, whereas another might allow access control
      # to also be specified at the Column level.
      #
      # ## Policy Structure
      #
      # See google.iam.v1.Policy
      #
      # This is intentionally not a CRUD style API because access control policies
      # are created and deleted implicitly with the resources to which they are
      # attached.
      #
      # @param version [::String, ::Symbol] The API version to connect to. Optional.
      #   Defaults to `:v1`.
      # @return [IAMPolicy::Client] A client object for the specified version.
