      # # Ruby Client for Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) API ([Alpha](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-ruby#versioning))
      #
      # [Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) API][Product Documentation]:
      # Manages keys and performs cryptographic operations in a central cloud
      # service, for direct use by other cloud resources and applications.
      # - [Product Documentation][]
      #
      # ## Quick Start
      # In order to use this library, you first need to go through the following
      # steps:
      #
      # 1. [Select or create a Cloud Platform project.](https://console.cloud.google.com/project)
      # 2. [Enable billing for your project.](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project#enable_billing_for_a_project)
      # 3. [Enable the Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) API.](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/cloudkms.googleapis.com)
      # 4. [Setup Authentication.](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-ruby/#/docs/google-cloud/master/guides/authentication)
      #
      # ### Installation
      # ```
      # $ gem install google-cloud-kms
      # ```
      #
      # ### Next Steps
      # - Read the [Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) API Product documentation][Product Documentation]
      #   to learn more about the product and see How-to Guides.
      # - View this [repository's main README](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-ruby/blob/master/README.md)
      #   to see the full list of Cloud APIs that we cover.

      # ## Enabling Logging
      #
      # To enable logging for this library, set the logger for the underlying [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/tree/master/src/ruby) library.
      # The logger that you set may be a Ruby stdlib [`Logger`](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.5.0/libdoc/logger/rdoc/Logger.html) as shown below,
      # or a [`Google::Cloud::Logging::Logger`](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-ruby/#/docs/google-cloud-logging/latest/google/cloud/logging/logger)
      # that will write logs to [Stackdriver Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging/). See [grpc/logconfig.rb](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/ruby/lib/grpc/logconfig.rb)
      # and the gRPC [spec_helper.rb](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/ruby/spec/spec_helper.rb) for additional information.
      #
      # Configuring a Ruby stdlib logger:
      #
      # ```ruby
      # require "logger"
      #
      # module MyLogger
      #   LOGGER = Logger.new $stderr, level: Logger::WARN
      #   def logger
      #     LOGGER
      #   end
      # end
      #
      # # Define a gRPC module-level logger method before grpc/logconfig.rb loads.
      # module GRPC
      #   extend MyLogger
      # end
      # ```
      #
      module V1
        # rubocop:enable LineLength

        ##
        # Google Cloud Key Management Service
        #
        # Manages cryptographic keys and operations using those keys. Implements a REST
        # model with the following objects:
        #
        # * {Google::Cloud::Kms::V1::KeyRing KeyRing}
        # * {Google::Cloud::Kms::V1::CryptoKey CryptoKey}
        # * {Google::Cloud::Kms::V1::CryptoKeyVersion CryptoKeyVersion}
        #
        # If you are using manual gRPC libraries, see
        # [Using gRPC with Cloud KMS](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/grpc).
        #
        # @param credentials [Google::Auth::Credentials, String, Hash, GRPC::Core::Channel, GRPC::Core::ChannelCredentials, Proc]
        #   Provides the means for authenticating requests made by the client. This parameter can
        #   be many types.
        #   A `Google::Auth::Credentials` uses a the properties of its represented keyfile for
        #   authenticating requests made by this client.
        #   A `String` will be treated as the path to the keyfile to be used for the construction of
        #   credentials for this client.
        #   A `Hash` will be treated as the contents of a keyfile to be used for the construction of
        #   credentials for this client.
        #   A `GRPC::Core::Channel` will be used to make calls through.
        #   A `GRPC::Core::ChannelCredentials` for the setting up the RPC client. The channel credentials
        #   should already be composed with a `GRPC::Core::CallCredentials` object.
        #   A `Proc` will be used as an updater_proc for the Grpc channel. The proc transforms the
        #   metadata for requests, generally, to give OAuth credentials.
        # @param scopes [Array<String>]
        #   The OAuth scopes for this service. This parameter is ignored if
        #   an updater_proc is supplied.
        # @param client_config [Hash]
        #   A Hash for call options for each method. See
        #   Google::Gax#construct_settings for the structure of
        #   this data. Falls back to the default config if not specified
        #   or the specified config is missing data points.
        # @param timeout [Numeric]
        #   The default timeout, in seconds, for calls made through this client.
        # @param metadata [Hash]
        #   Default metadata to be sent with each request. This can be overridden on a per call basis.
        # @param exception_transformer [Proc]
        #   An optional proc that intercepts any exceptions raised during an API call to inject
        #   custom error handling.
