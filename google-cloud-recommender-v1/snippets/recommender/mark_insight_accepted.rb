#
# This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code
# template only. It will require modifications to work:
# - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
# - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service
# client as shown in https://cloud.google.com/ruby/docs/reference.
#
# This is an auto-generated example demonstrating basic usage of
# Google::Cloud::Recommender::V1::Recommender::Client#mark_insight_accepted.
#
def mark_insight_accepted
  # Create a client object. The client can be reused for multiple calls.
  client = Google::Cloud::Recommender::V1::Recommender::Client.new

  request = Google::Cloud::Recommender::V1::MarkInsightAcceptedRequest.new

  # Call the mark_insight_accepted method.
  result = client.mark_insight_accepted request

  # The returned object is of type Google::Cloud::Recommender::V1::Insight.
