    ##
    # Manages long-running operations with an API service.
    #
    # When an API method normally takes long time to complete, it can be designed
    # to return {::Google::Longrunning::Operation Operation} to the client, and the
    # client can use this interface to receive the real response asynchronously by
    # polling the operation resource, or pass the operation resource to another API
    # (such as Pub/Sub API) to receive the response.  Any API service that returns
    # long-running operations should implement the `Operations` interface so
    # developers can have a consistent client experience.
    #
    # @example Load this service and instantiate a gRPC client
    #
    #     require "google/longrunning/operations"
    #     client = ::Google::Longrunning::Operations::Client.new
