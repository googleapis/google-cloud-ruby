# Snippet for the move_directory call in the Dataform service
#
# This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code
# template only. It will require modifications to work:
# - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
# - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service
# client as shown in https://cloud.google.com/ruby/docs/reference.
#
# This is an auto-generated example demonstrating basic usage of
# Google::Cloud::Dataform::V1beta1::Dataform::Client#move_directory.
#
def move_directory
  # Create a client object. The client can be reused for multiple calls.
  client = Google::Cloud::Dataform::V1beta1::Dataform::Client.new

  # Create a request. To set request fields, pass in keyword arguments.
  request = Google::Cloud::Dataform::V1beta1::MoveDirectoryRequest.new

  # Call the move_directory method.
  result = client.move_directory request

  # The returned object is of type Google::Cloud::Dataform::V1beta1::MoveDirectoryResponse.
  p result
