        #        a Google Cloud Storage Object is 'change'.

        #     Not all syntactically correct values are accepted by all services. For
        #     example:
        #
        #     1. The authorization model must support it. Google Cloud Functions
        #        only allows EventTriggers to be deployed that observe resources in the
        #        same project as the `CloudFunction`.
        #     2. The resource type must match the pattern expected for an
        #        `event_type`. For example, an `EventTrigger` that has an
        #        `event_type` of "google.pubsub.topic.publish" should have a resource
        #        that matches Google Cloud Pub/Sub topics.
        #
        #     Additionally, some services may support short names when creating an
        #     `EventTrigger`. These will always be returned in the normalized "long"
        #     format.
