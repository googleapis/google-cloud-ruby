      # Create a new client object for AccessApproval.
      #
      # By default, this returns an instance of
      # [Google::Cloud::AccessApproval::V1::AccessApproval::Client](https://googleapis.dev/ruby/google-cloud-access_approval-v1/latest/Google/Cloud/AccessApproval/V1/AccessApproval/Client.html)
      # for version V1 of the API.
      # However, you can specify specify a different API version by passing it in the
      # `version` parameter. If the AccessApproval service is
      # supported by that API version, and the corresponding gem is available, the
      # appropriate versioned client will be returned.
      #
      # ## About AccessApproval
      #
      # This API allows a customer to manage accesses to cloud resources by
      # Google personnel. It defines the following resource model:
      #
      # - The API has a collection of
      #   ApprovalRequest
      #   resources, named `approvalRequests/{approval_request}`
      # - The API has top-level settings per Project/Folder/Organization, named
      #   `accessApprovalSettings`
      #
      # The service also periodically emails a list of recipients, defined at the
      # Project/Folder/Organization level in the accessApprovalSettings, when there
      # is a pending ApprovalRequest for them to act on. The ApprovalRequests can
      # also optionally be published to a Pub/Sub topic owned by the customer
      # (contact support if you would like to enable Pub/Sub notifications).
      #
      # ApprovalRequests can be approved or dismissed. Google personnel can only
      # access the indicated resource or resources if the request is approved
      # (subject to some exclusions:
      # https://cloud.google.com/access-approval/docs/overview#exclusions).
      #
      # Note: Using Access Approval functionality will mean that Google may not be
      # able to meet the SLAs for your chosen products, as any support response times
      # may be dramatically increased. As such the SLAs do not apply to any service
      # disruption to the extent impacted by Customer's use of Access Approval. Do
      # not enable Access Approval for projects where you may require high service
      # availability and rapid response by Google Cloud Support.
      #
      # After a request is approved or dismissed, no further action may be taken on
      # it. Requests with the requested_expiration in the past or with no activity
      # for 14 days are considered dismissed. When an approval expires, the request
      # is considered dismissed.
      #
      # If a request is not approved or dismissed, we call it pending.
      #
      # @param version [::String, ::Symbol] The API version to connect to. Optional.
      #   Defaults to `:v1`.
      # @return [AccessApproval::Client] A client object for the specified version.
