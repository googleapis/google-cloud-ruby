        # OS policy assignment is an API resource that is used to
        # apply a set of OS policies to a dynamically targeted group of Compute Engine
        # VM instances.
        #
        # An OS policy is used to define the desired state configuration for a
        # Compute Engine VM instance through a set of configuration resources that
        # provide capabilities such as installing or removing software packages, or
        # executing a script.
        #
