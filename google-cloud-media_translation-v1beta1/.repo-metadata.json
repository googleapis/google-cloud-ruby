Leveraging Googleâ€™s machine learning technologies, the API offers enhanced accuracy and simplified integration while equipping you with a comprehensive set of features to further refine your translation results. Improve user experience with low-latency streaming translation and scale quickly with straightforward internationalization. Note that google-cloud-media_translation-v1beta1 is a version-specific client library. For most uses, we recommend installing the main client library google-cloud-media_translation instead.
