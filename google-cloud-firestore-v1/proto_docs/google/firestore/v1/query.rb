        #
        #     Firestore allows callers to provide a full ordering, a partial ordering, or
        #     no ordering at all. In all cases, Firestore guarantees a stable ordering
        #     through the following rules:
        #
        #      * The `order_by` is required to reference all fields used with an
        #        inequality filter.
        #      * All fields that are required to be in the `order_by` but are not already
        #        present are appended in lexicographical ordering of the field name.
        #      * If an order on `__name__` is not specified, it is appended by default.
        #
        #     Fields are appended with the same sort direction as the last order
        #     specified, or 'ASCENDING' if no order was specified. For example:
        #
        #      * `ORDER BY a` becomes `ORDER BY a ASC, __name__ ASC`
        #      * `ORDER BY a DESC` becomes `ORDER BY a DESC, __name__ DESC`
        #      * `WHERE a > 1` becomes `WHERE a > 1 ORDER BY a ASC, __name__ ASC`
        #      * `WHERE __name__ > ... AND a > 1` becomes
        #         `WHERE __name__ > ... AND a > 1 ORDER BY a ASC, __name__ ASC`
        # @!attribute [rw] start_at
        #   @return [::Google::Cloud::Firestore::V1::Cursor]
        #     A potential prefix of a position in the result set to start the query at.
        #
        #     The ordering of the result set is based on the `ORDER BY` clause of the
        #     original query.
        #
        #     ```
        #     SELECT * FROM k WHERE a = 1 AND b > 2 ORDER BY b ASC, __name__ ASC;
        #     ```
        #
        #     This query's results are ordered by `(b ASC, __name__ ASC)`.
        #
        #     Cursors can reference either the full ordering or a prefix of the location,
        #     though it cannot reference more fields than what are in the provided
        #     `ORDER BY`.
        #
        #     Continuing off the example above, attaching the following start cursors
        #     will have varying impact:
        #
        #     - `START BEFORE (2, /k/123)`: start the query right before `a = 1 AND
        #        b > 2 AND __name__ > /k/123`.
        #     - `START AFTER (10)`: start the query right after `a = 1 AND b > 10`.
        #
        #     Unlike `OFFSET` which requires scanning over the first N results to skip,
        #     a start cursor allows the query to begin at a logical position. This
        #     position is not required to match an actual result, it will scan forward
        #     from this position to find the next document.
        #
        #     Requires:
        #
        #     * The number of values cannot be greater than the number of fields
        #       specified in the `ORDER BY` clause.
        # @!attribute [rw] end_at
        #   @return [::Google::Cloud::Firestore::V1::Cursor]
        #     A potential prefix of a position in the result set to end the query at.
        #
        #     This is similar to `START_AT` but with it controlling the end position
        #     rather than the start position.
        #
        #     Requires:
        #
        #     * The number of values cannot be greater than the number of fields
        #       specified in the `ORDER BY` clause.
        # @!attribute [rw] offset
        #   @return [::Integer]
        #     The number of documents to skip before returning the first result.
        #

        #     `END AT` but before the `LIMIT` clause.

            #     ```
