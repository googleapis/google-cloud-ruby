# Snippet for the write call in the Firestore service
#
# This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code
# template only. It will require modifications to work:
# - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
# - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service
# client as shown in https://cloud.google.com/ruby/docs/reference.
#
# This is an auto-generated example demonstrating basic usage of
# Google::Cloud::Firestore::V1::Firestore::Client#write.
#
def write
  # Create a client object. The client can be reused for multiple calls.
  client = Google::Cloud::Firestore::V1::Firestore::Client.new

  # Create an input stream.
  input = Gapic::StreamInput.new

  # Call the write method to start streaming.
  output = client.write input

  # Send requests on the stream. For each request object, set fields by
  # passing keyword arguments. Be sure to close the stream when done.
  input << Google::Cloud::Firestore::V1::WriteRequest.new
  input << Google::Cloud::Firestore::V1::WriteRequest.new
  input.close

  # The returned object is a streamed enumerable yielding elements of type
  # ::Google::Cloud::Firestore::V1::WriteResponse
  output.each do |current_response|
    p current_response
