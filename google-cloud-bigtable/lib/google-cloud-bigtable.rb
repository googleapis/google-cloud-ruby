    #   The OAuth 2.0 scopes controlling the set of resources and operations

    #   The OAuth scopes for this service. This parameter is ignored if an
    #   updater_proc is supplied.
    # @param timeout [Integer]
    #   The default timeout, in seconds, for calls made through this client.
    # @param credentials [Google::Auth::Credentials, String, Hash, GRPC::Core::Channel,
    #   GRPC::Core::ChannelCredentials, Proc]
    #   Provides the means for authenticating requests made by the client. This parameter can
    #   be one of the following types.
    #   `Google::Auth::Credentials` uses the properties of its represented keyfile for
    #   authenticating requests made by this client.
    #   `String` will be treated as the path to the keyfile to use to construct
    #   credentials for this client.
    #   `Hash` will be treated as the contents of a keyfile to use to construct
    #   credentials for this client.
    #   `GRPC::Core::Channel` will be used to make calls through.
    #   `GRPC::Core::ChannelCredentials` will be used to set up the gRPC client. The channel credentials
    #   should already be composed with a `GRPC::Core::CallCredentials` object.
    #   `Proc` will be used as an updater_proc for the gRPC channel. The proc transforms the
    #   metadata for requests, generally, to give OAuth credentials.
