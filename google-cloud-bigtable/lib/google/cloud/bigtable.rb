      ##
      # Service for managing Cloud Bigtable instances and tables and for reading from and
      # writing to Bigtable tables.
      #
      # @param project_id [String]
      #   Project identifier for the Bigtable service you are connecting to.
      #   If not present, the default project for the credentials is used.
      # @param credentials [Google::Auth::Credentials, String, Hash, GRPC::Core::Channel,
      #   GRPC::Core::ChannelCredentials, Proc]
      #   Provides the means for authenticating requests made by the client. This parameter can
      #   be one of the following types:
      #   `Google::Auth::Credentials` uses the properties of its represented keyfile for
      #   authenticating requests made by this client.
      #   `String` will be treated as the path to the keyfile to use to construct
      #   credentials for this client.
      #   `Hash` will be treated as the contents of a keyfile to use to construct
      #   credentials for this client.
      #   `GRPC::Core::Channel` will be used to make calls through.
      #   `GRPC::Core::ChannelCredentials` for the setting up the gRPC client. The channel credentials
      #   should already be composed with a `GRPC::Core::CallCredentials` object.
      #   `Proc` will be used as an updater_proc for the gRPC channel. The proc transforms the
      #   metadata for requests, generally, to give OAuth credentials.
      # @param [String] endpoint Override of the endpoint host name. Optional.
      #   If the param is nil, uses the default endpoint.
      # @param [String] endpoint_admin Override of the admin service endpoint host name. Optional.
      #   If the param is nil, uses the default admin endpoint.
      # @param [String] emulator_host Bigtable emulator host. Optional.
      #   If the parameter is nil, uses the value of the `emulator_host` config.
      # @param scope [Array<String>]
      #   The OAuth 2.0 scopes controlling the set of resources and operations
      #   that the connection can access. See [Using OAuth 2.0 to Access Google
      #   APIs](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2).
      #   The OAuth scopes for this service. This parameter is ignored if an
      #   updater_proc is supplied.
      # @param timeout [Integer]
      #   The default timeout, in seconds, for calls made through this client. Optional.
      # @return [Google::Cloud::Bigtable::Project]
      #

      # * `scope` - (String, Array<String>) The OAuth 2.0 scopes controlling
      #   the set of resources and operations that the connection can access.
      # * `quota_project` - (String) The project ID for a project that can be
      #   used by client libraries for quota and billing purposes.
      # * `timeout` - (Integer) Default timeout to use in requests.
      # * `endpoint` - (String) Override of the endpoint host name, or `nil`
