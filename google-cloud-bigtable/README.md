# Ruby Client for Cloud Bigtable API

[Cloud Bigtable API][Product Documentation]:
API for reading and writing the contents of Bigtables associated with a
cloud project.
- [Client Library Documentation][]
- [Product Documentation][]

## Quick Start
In order to use this library, you first need to go through the following
steps:

1. [Select or create a Cloud Platform project.](https://console.cloud.google.com/project)
2. [Enable billing for your project.](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project#enable_billing_for_a_project)
3. [Enable the Cloud Bigtable API.](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/bigtable.googleapis.com)
4. [Setup Authentication.](https://googleapis.dev/ruby/google-cloud-bigtable/latest/file.AUTHENTICATION.html)

### Installation
```
$ gem install google-cloud-bigtable
```

### Next Steps
- Read the [Client Library Documentation][] for Cloud Bigtable API
  to see other available methods on the client.
- Read the [Cloud Bigtable API Product documentation][Product Documentation]
  to learn more about the product and see How-to Guides.
- View this [repository's main README](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-ruby/blob/master/README.md)
  to see the full list of Cloud APIs that we cover.

## Authentication

This library uses Service Account credentials to connect to Google Cloud services. When running on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), including Google Compute Engine (GCE), Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Google App Engine (GAE), Google Cloud Functions (GCF) and Cloud Run, the credentials will be discovered automatically. When running on other environments the Service Account credentials can be specified by providing the path to the JSON file, or the JSON itself, in environment variables.

Instructions and configuration options are covered in the [Authentication Guide](https://googleapis.dev/ruby/google-cloud-bigtable/latest/file.AUTHENTICATION.html).

## Example

```ruby
require "google/cloud/bigtable"

bigtable = Google::Cloud::Bigtable.new

table = bigtable.table("my-instance", "my-table")

entry = table.new_mutation_entry("user-1")
entry.set_cell(
  "cf1",
  "field1",
  "XYZ",
  timestamp: Time.now.to_i * 1000 # Time stamp in milli seconds.
).delete_cells("cf2", "field02")

table.mutate_row(entry)
```

## Enabling Logging

To enable logging for this library, set the logger for the underlying [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/tree/master/src/ruby) library. The logger that you set may be a Ruby stdlib [`Logger`](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/logger/rdoc/Logger.html) as shown below, or a [`Google::Cloud::Logging::Logger`](https://googleapis.dev/ruby/google-cloud-logging/latest) that will write logs to [Stackdriver Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging/). See [grpc/logconfig.rb](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/ruby/lib/grpc/logconfig.rb) and the gRPC [spec_helper.rb](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/ruby/spec/spec_helper.rb) for additional information.

Configuring a Ruby stdlib logger:

```ruby
require "logger"

module MyLogger
  LOGGER = Logger.new $stderr, level: Logger::WARN
  def logger
    LOGGER
  end
end

# Define a gRPC module-level logger method before grpc/logconfig.rb loads.
module GRPC
  extend MyLogger
end
```

## Supported Ruby Versions

This library is supported on Ruby 2.6+.

Google provides official support for Ruby versions that are actively supported
by Ruby Coreâ€”that is, Ruby versions that are either in normal maintenance or
in security maintenance, and not end of life. Older versions of Ruby _may_
still work, but are unsupported and not recommended. See
https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/branches/ for details about the Ruby
support schedule.
