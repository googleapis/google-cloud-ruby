            # a subscriber.
            #
            # An event provider is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) system or
            # product that can generate and deliver events through Eventarc.
            #
            # A third-party event provider is an event provider from outside of Google.
            #
            # A partner is a third-party event provider that is integrated with Eventarc.
            #
            # A subscriber is a GCP customer interested in receiving events.
            #
            # Channel is a first-class Eventarc resource that is created and managed
            # by the subscriber in their GCP project. A Channel represents a subscriber's
            # intent to receive events from an event provider. A Channel is associated with
            # exactly one event provider.
            #
            # ChannelConnection is a first-class Eventarc resource that
            # is created and managed by the partner in their GCP project. A
            # ChannelConnection represents a connection between a partner and a
            # subscriber's Channel. A ChannelConnection has a one-to-one mapping with a
            # Channel.
            #
            # Publisher allows an event provider to publish events to Eventarc.
