        #     Add logic to conditionally exclude sharing IP addresses from users from
        #     these regions and ensure that you provide users with clear and
        #     comprehensive information about the data you collect on your sites, apps,
        #     and other properties and get consent where required by law or any
        #     applicable Google policies. See the [About offline conversion
