# Snippet for the list_tasks call in the Tasks service

# This is an auto-generated example demonstrating basic usage of
# Google::Cloud::Run::V2::Tasks::Client#list_tasks. It may require modification
# in order to execute successfully.

  # Create a client object. The client can be reused for multiple calls.

  # Call the list_tasks method.

  # The returned object is of type Gapic::PagedEnumerable. You can iterate
