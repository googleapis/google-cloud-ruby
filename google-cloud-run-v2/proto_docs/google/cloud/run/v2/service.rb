        #     When a new Service is created, or an existing one is updated, Cloud Run

        #     `latest_ready_revison`, `traffic_statuses`, and `uri` will have transient

        #     succeeded and the serving state matches the Service, or there was an error,
        #     and reconciliation failed. This state can be found in
        #     `terminal_condition.state`.

        #     `latest_ready_revision` and `latest_created_revision`.
        #
        #     If reconciliation failed, `traffic_statuses`, `observed_generation`, and
        #     `latest_ready_revision` will have the state of the last serving revision,
        #     or empty for newly created Services. Additional information on the failure
