        #     When a new WorkerPool is created, or an existing one is updated, Cloud Run
        #     will asynchronously perform all necessary steps to bring the WorkerPool to
        #     the desired serving state. This process is called reconciliation. While
        #     reconciliation is in process, `observed_generation`,
        #     `latest_ready_revison`, `traffic_statuses`, and `uri` will have transient
        #     values that might mismatch the intended state: Once reconciliation is over

        #     succeeded and the serving state matches the WorkerPool, or there was an
        #     error, and reconciliation failed. This state can be found in
        #     `terminal_condition.state`.
