        #

        #
        #     The format of the input csv file should be one image per line.
        #     In each line, there are 8 columns.
        #
        #     1.  image-uri
        #     2.  image-id
        #     3.  product-set-id

        #     7.  labels
        #     8.  bounding-poly
        #
        #     The `image-uri`, `product-set-id`, `product-id`, and `product-category`
        #     columns are required. All other columns are optional.
        #
        #     If the `ProductSet` or `Product` specified by the `product-set-id` and
        #     `product-id` values does not exist, then the system will create a new
        #     `ProductSet` or `Product` for the image. In this case, the
        #     `product-display-name` column refers to
        #     {::Google::Cloud::Vision::V1::Product#display_name display_name}, the
        #     `product-category` column refers to
        #     {::Google::Cloud::Vision::V1::Product#product_category product_category}, and
        #     the `labels` column refers to
        #     {::Google::Cloud::Vision::V1::Product#product_labels product_labels}.
        #
        #     The `image-id` column is optional but must be unique if provided. If it is
        #     empty, the system will automatically assign a unique id to the image.
        #
        #     The `product-display-name` column is optional. If it is empty, the system
        #     sets the {::Google::Cloud::Vision::V1::Product#display_name display_name} field
        #     for the product to a space (" "). You can update the `display_name` later
        #     by using the API.
        #
        #     If a `Product` with the specified `product-id` already exists, then the
        #     system ignores the `product-display-name`, `product-category`, and `labels`
        #     columns.
        #
        #     The `labels` column (optional) is a line containing a list of
        #     comma-separated key-value pairs, in the following format:
        #
        #         "key_1=value_1,key_2=value_2,...,key_n=value_n"
        #
        #     The `bounding-poly` column (optional) identifies one region of
        #     interest from the image in the same manner as `CreateReferenceImage`. If
        #     you do not specify the `bounding-poly` column, then the system will try to
        #     detect regions of interest automatically.
        #
        #     At most one `bounding-poly` column is allowed per line. If the image
        #     contains multiple regions of interest, add a line to the CSV file that
        #     includes the same product information, and the `bounding-poly` values for
        #     each region of interest.
        #
        #     The `bounding-poly` column must contain an even number of comma-separated
        #     numbers, in the format "p1_x,p1_y,p2_x,p2_y,...,pn_x,pn_y". Use
        #     non-negative integers for absolute bounding polygons, and float values
        #     in [0, 1] for normalized bounding polygons.
        #
        #     The system will resize the image if the image resolution is too
        #     large to process (larger than 20MP).
