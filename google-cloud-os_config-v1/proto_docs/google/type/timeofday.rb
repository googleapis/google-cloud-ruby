module Google
  module Type
    # Represents a time of day. The date and time zone are either not significant
    # or are specified elsewhere. An API may choose to allow leap seconds. Related
    # types are {::Google::Type::Date google.type.Date} and
    # `google.protobuf.Timestamp`.
    # @!attribute [rw] hours
    #   @return [::Integer]
    #     Hours of day in 24 hour format. Should be from 0 to 23. An API may choose
    #     to allow the value "24:00:00" for scenarios like business closing time.
    # @!attribute [rw] minutes
    #   @return [::Integer]
    #     Minutes of hour of day. Must be from 0 to 59.
    # @!attribute [rw] seconds
    #   @return [::Integer]
    #     Seconds of minutes of the time. Must normally be from 0 to 59. An API may
    #     allow the value 60 if it allows leap-seconds.
    # @!attribute [rw] nanos
    #   @return [::Integer]
    #     Fractions of seconds in nanoseconds. Must be from 0 to 999,999,999.
