          # Using the Transcoder API, you can queue asynchronous jobs for transcoding
          # media into various output formats. Output formats may include different
          # streaming standards such as HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) and Dynamic Adaptive
          # Streaming over HTTP (DASH). You can also customize jobs using advanced
          # features such as Digital Rights Management (DRM), audio equalization, content
          # concatenation, and digital ad-stitch ready content generation.
