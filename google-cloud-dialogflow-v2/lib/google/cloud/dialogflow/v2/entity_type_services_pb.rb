          # Entities are extracted from user input and represent parameters that are
          # meaningful to your application. For example, a date range, a proper name
          # such as a geographic location or landmark, and so on. Entities represent
          # actionable data for your application.
          #
          # When you define an entity, you can also include synonyms that all map to
          # that entity. For example, "soft drink", "soda", "pop", and so on.
          #
          # There are three types of entities:
          #
          # *   **System** - entities that are defined by the Dialogflow API for common
          #     data types such as date, time, currency, and so on. A system entity is
          #     represented by the `EntityType` type.
          #
          # *   **Custom** - entities that are defined by you that represent
          #     actionable data that is meaningful to your application. For example,
          #     you could define a `pizza.sauce` entity for red or white pizza sauce,
          #     a `pizza.cheese` entity for the different types of cheese on a pizza,
          #     a `pizza.topping` entity for different toppings, and so on. A custom
          #     entity is represented by the `EntityType` type.
          #
          # *   **User** - entities that are built for an individual user such as
          #     favorites, preferences, playlists, and so on. A user entity is
          #     represented by the [SessionEntityType][google.cloud.dialogflow.v2.SessionEntityType] type.
          #
          # For more information about entity types, see the
          # [Dialogflow
          # documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/entities-overview).
