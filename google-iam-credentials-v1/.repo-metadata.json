You can also use this API to sign JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), as well as blobs of binary data that contain other types of tokens. Note that google-iam-credentials-v1 is a version-specific client library. For most uses, we recommend installing the main client library google-iam-credentials instead. See the readme for more details.",
