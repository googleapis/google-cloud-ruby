# Ruby Client for the Google Cloud Compute V1 (BETA) API

API Client library for the Google Cloud Compute V1 (BETA) API

google-cloud-compute-v1 is the official client library for the Google Cloud Compute V1 API. This library is considered to be in beta. This means while stable it is still a work-in-progress and under active development, and might get backwards-incompatible changes at any time.

1. [Select or create a Cloud Platform project.](https://console.cloud.google.com/project)

## Quick Start

```ruby

for general usage information.

## Supported Ruby Versions

This library is supported on Ruby 2.5+.

Google provides official support for Ruby versions that are actively supported
by Ruby Coreâ€”that is, Ruby versions that are either in normal maintenance or
in security maintenance, and not end of life. Currently, this means Ruby 2.5
and later. Older versions of Ruby _may_ still work, but are unsupported and not
recommended. See https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/branches/ for details
about the Ruby support schedule.
