This pattern may result in\na conflict if two or more processes attempt the sequence simultaneously.\nIAM solves this problem with the Google::Cloud::Spanner::Policy#etag\nproperty, which is used to verify whether the policy has changed since\nthe last request. When you make a request to with an <code>etag</code> value, Cloud\nIAM compares the <code>etag</code> value in the request with the existing <code>etag</code>\nvalue associated with the policy. It writes the policy only if the\n<code>etag</code> values match.</p>\n\n<p>When you update a policy, first read the policy (and its current <code>etag</code>)\nfrom the service, then modify the policy locally, and then write the\nmodified policy to the service.
