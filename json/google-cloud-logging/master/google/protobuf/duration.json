{"id":"google/protobuf/duration","name":"Duration","title":["Google","Protobuf","Duration"],"description":"<p>A Duration represents a signed, fixed-length span of time represented\nas a count of seconds and fractions of seconds at nanosecond\nresolution. It is independent of any calendar and concepts like “day”\nor “month”. It is related to Timestamp in that the difference between\ntwo Timestamp values is a Duration and it can be added or subtracted\nfrom a Timestamp. Range is approximately +-10,000 years.</p>\n\n<p>Example 1: Compute Duration from two Timestamps in pseudo code.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Timestamp start = ...;\nTimestamp end = ...;\nDuration duration = ...;\n\nduration.seconds = end.seconds - start.seconds;\nduration.nanos = end.nanos - start.nanos;\n\nif (duration.seconds &lt; 0 &amp;&amp; duration.nanos &gt; 0) {\n  duration.seconds += 1;\n  duration.nanos -= 1000000000;\n} else if (durations.seconds &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; duration.nanos &lt; 0) {\n  duration.seconds -= 1;\n  duration.nanos += 1000000000;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Example 2: Compute Timestamp from Timestamp + Duration in pseudo code.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Timestamp start = ...;\nDuration duration = ...;\nTimestamp end = ...;\n\nend.seconds = start.seconds + duration.seconds;\nend.nanos = start.nanos + duration.nanos;\n\nif (end.nanos &lt; 0) {\n  end.seconds -= 1;\n  end.nanos += 1000000000;\n} else if (end.nanos &gt;= 1000000000) {\n  end.seconds += 1;\n  end.nanos -= 1000000000;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Example 3: Compute Duration from datetime.timedelta in Python.</p>\n\n<pre><code>td = datetime.timedelta(days=3, minutes=10)\nduration = Duration()\nduration.FromTimedelta(td)\n</code></pre>","source":"google-cloud-logging/lib/google/cloud/logging/v2/doc/google/protobuf/duration.rb#L75","resources":[],"examples":[],"methods":[{"id":"seconds-instance","type":"instance","name":"seconds","title":["Google","Protobuf","Duration#seconds"],"description":"","source":"google-cloud-logging/lib/google/cloud/logging/v2/doc/google/protobuf/duration.rb#L75","resources":[],"examples":[],"params":[],"exceptions":[],"returns":[{"types":["Integer"],"description":"Signed seconds of the span of time.
