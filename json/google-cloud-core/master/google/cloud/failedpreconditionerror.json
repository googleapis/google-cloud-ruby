E.g., if an “rmdir”\n     fails because the directory is non-empty, FailedPrecondition\n     should be returned since the client should not retry unless\n     they have first fixed up the directory by deleting files from it.\n (d) Use FailedPrecondition if the client performs conditional\n     REST Get/Update/Delete on a resource and the resource on the\n     server does not match the condition. E.g., conflicting\n     read-modify-write on the same resource.</p>","source":"google-cloud-core/lib/google/cloud/errors.rb#L149","resources":[],"examples":[],"methods":[]}
