{"id":"gcloud/outofrangeerror","name":"OutOfRangeError","title":["Gcloud","OutOfRangeError"],"description":"<p>OutOfRange means operation was attempted past the valid range.\nE.g., seeking or reading past end of file.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike InvalidArgument, this error indicates a problem that may\nbe fixed if the system state changes. For example, a 32-bit file\nsystem will generate InvalidArgument if asked to read at an\noffset that is not in the range [0,2^32-1], but it will generate\nOutOfRange if asked to read from an offset past the current\nfile size.</p>\n\n<p>There is a fair bit of overlap between FailedPrecondition and\nOutOfRange.  We recommend using OutOfRange (the more specific\nerror) when it applies so that callers who are iterating through\na space can easily look for an OutOfRange error to detect when\nthey are done.</p>","source":"lib/gcloud/errors.rb#L176","resources":[],"examples":[],"methods":[]}
