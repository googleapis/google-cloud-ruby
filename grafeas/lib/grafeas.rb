module Grafeas
  ##
  # Create a new client object for Grafeas.
  #
  # By default, this returns an instance of
  # [Grafeas::V1::Grafeas::Client](https://cloud.google.com/ruby/docs/reference/grafeas-v1/latest/Grafeas-V1-Grafeas-Client)
  # for a gRPC client for version V1 of the API.
  # However, you can specify a different API version by passing it in the
  # `version` parameter. If the Grafeas service is
  # supported by that API version, and the corresponding gem is available, the
  # appropriate versioned client will be returned.
  #
  # ## About Grafeas
  #
  # [Grafeas](https://grafeas.io) API.
  #
  # Retrieves analysis results of Cloud components such as Docker container
  # images.
  #
  # Analysis results are stored as a series of occurrences. An `Occurrence`
  # contains information about a specific analysis instance on a resource. An
  # occurrence refers to a `Note`. A note contains details describing the
  # analysis and is generally stored in a separate project, called a `Provider`.
  # Multiple occurrences can refer to the same note.
  #
  # For example, an SSL vulnerability could affect multiple images. In this case,
  # there would be one note for the vulnerability and an occurrence for each
  # image with the vulnerability referring to that note.
  #
  # @param version [::String, ::Symbol] The API version to connect to. Optional.
  #   Defaults to `:v1`.
  # @return [::Object] A client object for the specified version.
  #
