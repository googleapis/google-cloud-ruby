            #     Required. A comma-separated list of paths, relative to `Environment`, of
            #     fields to update.
            #     For example, to set the version of scikit-learn to install in the
            #     environment to 0.19.0 and to remove an existing installation of
            #     numpy, the `updateMask` parameter would include the following two
            #     `paths` values: "config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages.scikit-learn" and
            #     "config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages.numpy". The included patch
            #     environment would specify the scikit-learn version as follows:
            #
            #         {
            #           "config":{
            #             "softwareConfig":{
            #               "pypiPackages":{
            #                 "scikit-learn":"==0.19.0"
            #               }
            #             }
            #           }
            #         }
            #
            #     Note that in the above example, any existing PyPI packages
            #     other than scikit-learn and numpy will be unaffected.
            #
            #     Only one update type may be included in a single request's `updateMask`.
            #     For example, one cannot update both the PyPI packages and
            #     labels in the same request. However, it is possible to update multiple
            #     members of a map field simultaneously in the same request. For example,
            #     to set the labels "label1" and "label2" while clearing "label3" (assuming
            #     it already exists), one can
            #     provide the paths "labels.label1", "labels.label2", and "labels.label3"
            #     and populate the patch environment as follows:
            #
            #         {
            #           "labels":{
            #             "label1":"new-label1-value"
            #             "label2":"new-label2-value"
            #           }
            #         }
            #
            #     Note that in the above example, any existing labels that are not
            #     included in the `updateMask` will be unaffected.
            #
            #     It is also possible to replace an entire map field by providing the
            #     map field's path in the `updateMask`. The new value of the field will
            #     be that which is provided in the patch environment. For example, to
            #     delete all pre-existing user-specified PyPI packages and
            #     install botocore at version 1.7.14, the `updateMask` would contain
            #     the path "config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages", and
            #     the patch environment would be the following:
            #
            #         {
            #           "config":{
            #             "softwareConfig":{
            #               "pypiPackages":{
            #                 "botocore":"==1.7.14"
            #               }
            #             }
            #           }
            #         }
            #
            #     **Note:** Only the following fields can be updated:

            #     * `config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages`
