Cloud Composer is a fully managed workflow orchestration service, enabling you to create, schedule, monitor, and manage workflows that span across clouds and on-premises data centers. Note that google-cloud-orchestration-airflow-service-v1 is a version-specific client library. For most uses, we recommend installing the main client library google-cloud-orchestration-airflow-service instead. See the readme for more details.",
