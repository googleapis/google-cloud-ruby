          # CloudChannelService lets Google cloud resellers and distributors manage
          # their customers, channel partners, entitlements, and reports.
          #
          # Using this service:
          # 1. Resellers and distributors can manage a customer entity.
          # 2. Distributors can register an authorized reseller in their channel and
          #    provide them with delegated admin access.
          # 3. Resellers and distributors can manage customer entitlements.
          #
          # CloudChannelService exposes the following resources:
          # - [Customer][google.cloud.channel.v1.Customer]s: An entity—usually an enterprise—managed by a reseller or
          # distributor.
          #
          # - [Entitlement][google.cloud.channel.v1.Entitlement]s: An entity that provides a customer with the means to use
          # a service. Entitlements are created or updated as a result of a successful
          # fulfillment.
          #
          # - [ChannelPartnerLink][google.cloud.channel.v1.ChannelPartnerLink]s: An entity that identifies links between
          # distributors and their indirect resellers in a channel.
