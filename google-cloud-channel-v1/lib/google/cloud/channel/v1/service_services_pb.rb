          # CloudChannelService enables Google cloud resellers and distributors to manage
          # their customers, channel partners, entitlements and reports.
          #
          # Using this service:
          # 1. Resellers or distributors can manage a customer entity.
          # 2. Distributors can register an authorized reseller in their channel and then
          #    enable delegated admin access for the reseller.
          # 3. Resellers or distributors can manage entitlements for their customers.
          #
          # The service primarily exposes the following resources:
          # - [Customer][google.cloud.channel.v1.Customer]s: A Customer represents an entity managed by a reseller or
          # distributor. A customer typically represents an enterprise. In an n-tier
          # resale channel hierarchy, customers are generally represented as leaf nodes.
          # Customers primarily have an Entitlement sub-resource discussed below.
          #
          # - [Entitlement][google.cloud.channel.v1.Entitlement]s: An Entitlement represents an entity which provides a
          # customer means to start using a service. Entitlements are created or updated
          # as a result of a successful fulfillment.
          #
          # - [ChannelPartnerLink][google.cloud.channel.v1.ChannelPartnerLink]s: A ChannelPartnerLink is an entity that identifies
          # links between distributors and their indirect resellers in a channel.
