          # information from a running application, without stopping or slowing it down
          # and without modifying its state.  An application may include one or
          # more replicated processes performing the same work.

          # A debugged application is represented using the Debuggee concept. The
          # Debugger service provides a way to query for available debuggees, but does
          # not provide a way to create one.  A debuggee is created using the Controller
          # service, usually by running a debugger agent with the application.

          # The Debugger service enables the client to set one or more Breakpoints on a
          # Debuggee and collect the results of the set Breakpoints.
