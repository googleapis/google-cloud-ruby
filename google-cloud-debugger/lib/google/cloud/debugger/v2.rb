      # # Ruby Client for Stackdriver Debugger API ([Alpha](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-ruby#versioning))
      #
      # [Stackdriver Debugger API][Product Documentation]:
      # Examines the call stack and variables of a running application
      # without stopping or slowing it down.
      # - [Product Documentation][]
      #
      # ## Quick Start
      # In order to use this library, you first need to go through the following
      # steps:
      #
      # 1. [Select or create a Cloud Platform project.](https://console.cloud.google.com/project)
      # 2. [Enable billing for your project.](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project#enable_billing_for_a_project)
      # 3. [Enable the Stackdriver Debugger API.](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/clouddebugger.googleapis.com)
      # 4. [Setup Authentication.](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-ruby/#/docs/google-cloud/master/guides/authentication)
      #
      # ### Installation
      # ```
      # $ gem install google-cloud-debugger
      # ```
      #
      # ### Next Steps
      # - Read the [Stackdriver Debugger API Product documentation][Product Documentation]
      #   to learn more about the product and see How-to Guides.
      # - View this [repository's main README](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-ruby/blob/master/README.md)

      # ## Enabling Logging
      #
      # To enable logging for this library, set the logger for the underlying [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/tree/master/src/ruby) library.
      # The logger that you set may be a Ruby stdlib [`Logger`](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.5.0/libdoc/logger/rdoc/Logger.html) as shown below,
      # or a [`Google::Cloud::Logging::Logger`](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-ruby/#/docs/google-cloud-logging/latest/google/cloud/logging/logger)
      # that will write logs to [Stackdriver Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging/). See [grpc/logconfig.rb](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/ruby/lib/grpc/logconfig.rb)
      # and the gRPC [spec_helper.rb](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/ruby/spec/spec_helper.rb) for additional information.
      #
      # Configuring a Ruby stdlib logger:
      #
      # ```ruby
      # require "logger"
      #
      # module MyLogger
      #   LOGGER = Logger.new $stderr, level: Logger::WARN
      #   def logger
      #     LOGGER
      #   end
      # end
      #
      # # Define a gRPC module-level logger method before grpc/logconfig.rb loads.
      # module GRPC
      #   extend MyLogger
      # end
      # ```

          # The Debugger service provides the API that allows users to collect run-time
          # information from a running application, without stopping or slowing it down
          # and without modifying its state.  An application may include one or
          # more replicated processes performing the same work.
          #
          # A debugged application is represented using the Debuggee concept. The
          # Debugger service provides a way to query for available debuggees, but does
          # not provide a way to create one.  A debuggee is created using the Controller
          # service, usually by running a debugger agent with the application.
          #
          # The Debugger service enables the client to set one or more Breakpoints on a
          # Debuggee and collect the results of the set Breakpoints.
