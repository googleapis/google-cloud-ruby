# Creates a new Anywhere Cache for a specified bucket and waits for it
# to become active.
#
# This method initiates the creation of an Anywhere Cache in the given zone for
# the specified bucket. After sending the creation request, it polls the status
# of the cache with an exponential backoff strategy until the cache's state is
# "running". Progress and final status are printed to the console.
#
# @param bucket_name [String] The name of the bucket.
# @param zone [String] The zone where the Anywhere Cache instance should be
#   located (e.g., "us-east1-b").
#
# @example
#   create_anywhere_cache(
#     bucket_name: "your-unique-bucket-name",
#     zone: "us-east1-b"
#   )
