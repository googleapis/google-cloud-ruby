        # The resource names are assigned by the server.
        # The server never reuses names that it has created after the resources with
        # those names are deleted.
        #
        # An ID of a resource is the last element of the item's resource name. For
        # `projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/datasets/{dataset_id}`, then
        # the id for the item is `{dataset_id}`.

        # Currently the only supported `location_id` is "us-central1".
