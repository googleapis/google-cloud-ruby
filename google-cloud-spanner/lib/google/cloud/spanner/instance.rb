      # Represents a Cloud Spanner instance. Instances are dedicated Cloud
      # Spanner serving and storage resources to be used by Cloud Spanner
      # databases. Instances offer isolation: problems with databases in one
      # instance will not affect other instances. However, within an instance
      # databases can affect each other. For example, if one database in an
      # instance receives a lot of requests and consumes most of the instance
      # resources, fewer resources are available for other databases in that
      # instance, and their performance may suffer.
      #

        #   The long-running operation
        #   `Google::Longrunning::Operation#metadata` metadata field type
        #   `metadata.type_url` describes the type of the metadata.
        #
        #   The filter expression must specify the field name,
        #   a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for
        #   filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean.
        #   The comparison operator must be
        #   <, >, <=, >=, !=, =, or :. Colon ':' represents a HAS operator
        #   which is roughly synonymous with equality. Filter rules are case
        #   insensitive.
        #
        #   The long-running operation fields eligible for filtering are:
        #     * `name` --> The name of the long-running operation
        #     * `done` --> False if the operation is in progress, else true.
        #     * `metadata.type_url` (using filter string `metadata.@type`) and
        #       fields in `metadata.value` (using filter string
        #       `metadata.<field_name>`, where <field_name> is a field in
        #       metadata.value) are eligible for filtering.
        #     * `error` --> Error associated with the long-running operation.
        #     * `response.type_url` (using filter string `response.@type`) and
        #       fields in `response.value` (using filter string
        #       `response.<field_name>`, where <field_name> is a field in
        #       response.value)are eligible for filtering.
        #
        #     To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
        #     expression within parentheses. By default, each expression
        #     is an AND expression. However, you can include AND, OR, and NOT
        #     expressions explicitly.
        #
        #   Some examples of using filters are:
        #
        #     * `done:true` --> The operation is complete.
        #     * `(metadata.@type:type.googleapis.com/google.spanner.admin.\
        #       database.v1.RestoreDatabaseMetadata)
        #       AND (metadata.source_type:BACKUP)
        #       AND (metadata.backup_info.backup:backup_howl)
        #       AND (metadata.name:restored_howl)
        #       AND (metadata.progress.start_time < \"2018-03-28T14:50:00Z\")

        #   * pubsub.instances.delete
        #
        # @return [Array<Strings>] The permissions that have access.
        #
        # @example
        #   require "google/cloud/spanner"
