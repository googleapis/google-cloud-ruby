    # # Ruby Client for Google Cloud Natural Language API ([Alpha](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-ruby#versioning))
    #
    # [Google Cloud Natural Language API][Product Documentation]:
    # Google Cloud Natural Language API provides natural language understanding
    # technologies to developers. Examples include sentiment analysis, entity
    # recognition, and text annotations.
    # - [Product Documentation][]
    #
    # *This release, 0.28.0, introduces breaking changes relative to the previous
    # release, 0.27.1. For more details and instructions to migrate your code, please
    # visit the [migration guide](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/ruby-client-migration).*
    #
    # ## Quick Start
    # In order to use this library, you first need to go through the following
    # steps:
    #
    # 1. [Select or create a Cloud Platform project.](https://console.cloud.google.com/project)
    # 2. [Enable the Google Cloud Natural Language API.](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/language)
    # 3. [Setup Authentication.](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-ruby/#/docs/google-cloud/master/guides/authentication)
    #
    # ### Preview
    # #### LanguageServiceClient
    # ```rb
    # require "google/cloud/language"
    #
    # language_service_client = Google::Cloud::Language.new
    # content = "Hello, world!"
    # type = :PLAIN_TEXT
    # document = { content: content, type: type }
    # response = language_service_client.analyze_sentiment(document)
    # ```
    #
    # ### Next Steps
    # - Read the [Google Cloud Natural Language API Product documentation][Product Documentation]
    #   to learn more about the product and see How-to Guides.
    # - View this [repository's main README](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-ruby/blob/master/README.md)
    #   to see the full list of Cloud APIs that we cover.

      # @param version [Symbol, String]
      #   The major version of the service to be used. By default :v1
      #   is used.
      # @overload new(version:, credentials:, scopes:, client_config:, timeout:)
      #   @param credentials [Google::Auth::Credentials, String, Hash, GRPC::Core::Channel, GRPC::Core::ChannelCredentials, Proc]
      #     Provides the means for authenticating requests made by the client. This parameter can
      #     be many types.
      #     A `Google::Auth::Credentials` uses a the properties of its represented keyfile for
      #     authenticating requests made by this client.
      #     A `String` will be treated as the path to the keyfile to be used for the construction of
      #     credentials for this client.
      #     A `Hash` will be treated as the contents of a keyfile to be used for the construction of
      #     credentials for this client.
      #     A `GRPC::Core::Channel` will be used to make calls through.
      #     A `GRPC::Core::ChannelCredentials` for the setting up the RPC client. The channel credentials
      #     should already be composed with a `GRPC::Core::CallCredentials` object.
      #     A `Proc` will be used as an updater_proc for the Grpc channel. The proc transforms the
      #     metadata for requests, generally, to give OAuth credentials.
      #   @param scopes [Array<String>]
      #     The OAuth scopes for this service. This parameter is ignored if
      #     an updater_proc is supplied.
      #   @param client_config [Hash]
      #     A Hash for call options for each method. See
      #     Google::Gax#construct_settings for the structure of
      #     this data. Falls back to the default config if not specified
      #     or the specified config is missing data points.
      #   @param timeout [Numeric]
      #     The default timeout, in seconds, for calls made through this client.
