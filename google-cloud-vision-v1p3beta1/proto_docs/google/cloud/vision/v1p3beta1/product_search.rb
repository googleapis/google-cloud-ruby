        # @!attribute [rw] bounding_poly
        #   @return [::Google::Cloud::Vision::V1p3beta1::BoundingPoly]
        #     The bounding polygon around the area of interest in the image.
        #     If it is not specified, system discretion will be applied.
        # @!attribute [rw] product_set
        #   @return [::String]
        #     The resource name of a {::Google::Cloud::Vision::V1p3beta1::ProductSet ProductSet} to be searched for similar images.
        #
        #     Format is:
        #     `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOC_ID/productSets/PRODUCT_SET_ID`.
        # @!attribute [rw] product_categories
        #   @return [::Array<::String>]
        #     The list of product categories to search in. Currently, we only consider
        #     the first category, and either "homegoods-v2", "apparel-v2", "toys-v2",
        #     "packagedgoods-v1", or "general-v1" should be specified. The legacy
        #     categories "homegoods", "apparel", and "toys" are still supported but will
        #     be deprecated. For new products, please use "homegoods-v2", "apparel-v2",
        #     or "toys-v2" for better product search accuracy. It is recommended to
        #     migrate existing products to these categories as well.
        # @!attribute [rw] filter
        #   @return [::String]
        #     The filtering expression. This can be used to restrict search results based
        #     on Product labels. We currently support an AND of OR of key-value
        #     expressions, where each expression within an OR must have the same key. An
        #     '=' should be used to connect the key and value.
        #
        #     For example, "(color = red OR color = blue) AND brand = Google" is
        #     acceptable, but "(color = red OR brand = Google)" is not acceptable.
        #     "color: red" is not acceptable because it uses a ':' instead of an '='.
