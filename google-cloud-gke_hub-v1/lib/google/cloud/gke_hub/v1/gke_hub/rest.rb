        ##
        # The GKE Hub service handles the registration of many Kubernetes clusters to
        # Google Cloud, and the management of multi-cluster features over those
        # clusters.
        #
        # The GKE Hub service operates on the following resources:
        #
        # * {::Google::Cloud::GkeHub::V1::Membership Membership}
        # * {::Google::Cloud::GkeHub::V1::Feature Feature}
        #
        # GKE Hub is currently available in the global region and all regions in
        # https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones. Feature is only
        # available in global region while membership is global region and all the
        # regions.
        #
        # **Membership management may be non-trivial:** it is recommended to use one
        # of the Google-provided client libraries or tools where possible when working
        # with Membership resources.
        #
        # To load this service and instantiate a REST client:
        #
        #     require "google/cloud/gke_hub/v1/gke_hub/rest"
        #     client = ::Google::Cloud::GkeHub::V1::GkeHub::Rest::Client.new
        #
        module GkeHub
          # Client for the REST transport
          module Rest
          end
        end
