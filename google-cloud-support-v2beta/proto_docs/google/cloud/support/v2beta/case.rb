        # A Case is an object that contains the details of a support case. It
        # contains fields for the time it was created, its priority, its
        # classification, and more. Cases can also have comments and attachments that
        # get added over time.
        #
        # A case is parented by a Google Cloud organization or project.
        #
        # Organizations are identified by a number, so the name of a case parented by
        # an organization would look like this:
        #
        # ```
        # organizations/123/cases/456
        # ```
        #
        # Projects have two unique identifiers, an ID and a number, and they look like
        # this:
        #
        # ```
        # projects/abc/cases/456
        # ```
        #
        # ```
        # projects/123/cases/456
        # ```
