        # An Attachment contains metadata about a file that was uploaded to a
        # case - it is NOT a file itself. That being said, the name of an Attachment
        # object can be used to download its accompanying file through the
        # `media.download` endpoint.
        #
        # While attachments can be uploaded in the console at the
        # same time as a comment, they're associated on a "case" level, not a
        # "comment" level.
