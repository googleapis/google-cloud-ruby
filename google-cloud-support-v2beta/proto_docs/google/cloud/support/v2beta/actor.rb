        # could be a user who posted a comment on a support case, a user who
        # uploaded an attachment, or a service account that created a support case.
        # @!attribute [rw] display_name
        #   @return [::String]
        #     The name to display for the actor. If not provided, it is inferred from
        #     credentials supplied during case creation. When an email is provided, a
        #     display name must also be provided. This will be obfuscated if the user
        #     is a Google Support agent.
        # @!attribute [rw] email
        #   @deprecated This field is deprecated and may be removed in the next major version update.

        #     from the credentials supplied. When a name is provided, a username must
        #     also be provided. If the user is a Google Support agent, this will not be
