          # The Artifact Registry API service.
          #
          # Artifact Registry is an artifact management system for storing artifacts
          # from different package management systems.
          #
          # The resources managed by this API are:
          #
          # * Repositories, which group packages and their data.
          # * Packages, which group versions and their tags.
          # * Versions, which are specific forms of a package.
          # * Tags, which represent alternative names for versions.
          # * Files, which contain content and are optionally associated with a Package
          #   or Version.
