# Snippet for the create_rule call in the ArtifactRegistry service
#
# This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code
# template only. It will require modifications to work:
# - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
# - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service
# client as shown in https://cloud.google.com/ruby/docs/reference.
#
# This is an auto-generated example demonstrating basic usage of
# Google::Cloud::ArtifactRegistry::V1::ArtifactRegistry::Client#create_rule.
#
def create_rule
  # Create a client object. The client can be reused for multiple calls.
  client = Google::Cloud::ArtifactRegistry::V1::ArtifactRegistry::Client.new

  # Create a request. To set request fields, pass in keyword arguments.
  request = Google::Cloud::ArtifactRegistry::V1::CreateRuleRequest.new

  # Call the create_rule method.
  result = client.create_rule request

  # The returned object is of type Google::Cloud::ArtifactRegistry::V1::Rule.
  p result
