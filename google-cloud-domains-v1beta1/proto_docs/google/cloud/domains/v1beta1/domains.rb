        # The `Registration` resource facilitates managing and configuring domain name
        # registrations.
        #
        # There are several ways to create a new `Registration` resource:
        #
        # To create a new `Registration` resource, find a suitable domain name by
        # calling the `SearchDomains` method with a query to see available domain name
        # options. After choosing a name, call `RetrieveRegisterParameters` to
        # ensure availability and obtain information like pricing, which is needed to
        # build a call to `RegisterDomain`.
        #
        # Another way to create a new `Registration` is to transfer an existing
        # domain from another registrar. First, go to the current registrar to unlock
        # the domain for transfer and retrieve the domain's transfer authorization
        # code. Then call `RetrieveTransferParameters` to confirm that the domain is
        # unlocked and to get values needed to build a call to `TransferDomain`.
