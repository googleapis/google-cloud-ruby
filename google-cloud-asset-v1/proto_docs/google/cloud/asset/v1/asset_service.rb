        #     table(s).
        #

        #     written to partitioned table(s) with two additional timestamp columns,
        #     readTime and requestTime, one of which will be the partition key. Secondly,

        #     update existing table's schema as necessary by appending additional
        #     columns. Then, if [force] is `TRUE`, the corresponding partition will be
        #     overwritten by the snapshot results (data in different partitions will
        #     remain intact); if [force] is unset or `FALSE`, it will append the data. An
        #     error will be returned if the schema update or data appension fails.

        #     If this flag is `TRUE`, the snapshot results will be written to one or
        #     multiple tables, each of which contains results of one asset type. The
        #     [force] and [partition_spec] fields will apply to each of them.
        #
        #     Field [table] will be concatenated with "_" and the asset type names (see
        #     https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/supported-asset-types for
        #     supported asset types) to construct per-asset-type table names, in which
        #     all non-alphanumeric characters like "." and "/" will be substituted by
        #     "_". Example: if field [table] is "mytable" and snapshot results
        #     contain "storage.googleapis.com/Bucket" assets, the corresponding table
        #     name will be "mytable_storage_googleapis_com_Bucket". If any of these
        #     tables does not exist, a new table with the concatenated name will be
        #     created.
        #
        #     When [content_type] in the ExportAssetsRequest is `RESOURCE`, the schema of
        #     each table will include RECORD-type columns mapped to the nested fields in
        #     the Asset.resource.data field of that asset type (up to the 15 nested level
        #     BigQuery supports
        #     (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/nested-repeated#limitations)). The
        #     fields in >15 nested levels will be stored in JSON format string as a child
        #     column of its parent RECORD column.
        #
        #     If error occurs when exporting to any table, the whole export call will
        #     return an error but the export results that already succeed will persist.
        #     Example: if exporting to table_type_A succeeds when exporting to
        #     table_type_B fails during one export call, the results in table_type_A will
        #     persist and there will not be partial results persisting in a table.

        #     policy structure, see [IAM policy

        #
        #     Examples:

        #       "amy@gmail.com".
        #     * `policy:roles/compute.admin` to find IAM policy bindings that specify
        #       the Compute Admin role.
        #     * `policy:comp*` to find IAM policy bindings that contain "comp" as a
        #       prefix of any word in the binding.
        #     * `policy.role.permissions:storage.buckets.update` to find IAM policy
        #       bindings that specify a role containing "storage.buckets.update"
        #       permission. Note that if callers don't have `iam.roles.get` access to a
        #       role's included permissions, policy bindings that specify this role will
        #       be dropped from the search results.
        #     * `policy.role.permissions:upd*` to find IAM policy bindings that specify a
        #       role containing "upd" as a prefix of any word in the role permission.
        #       Note that if callers don't have `iam.roles.get` access to a role's
        #       included permissions, policy bindings that specify this role will be
        #       dropped from the search results.
        #     * `resource:organizations/123456` to find IAM policy bindings
        #       that are set on "organizations/123456".
        #     * `resource=//cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/myproject` to
        #       find IAM policy bindings that are set on the project named "myproject".
        #     * `Important` to find IAM policy bindings that contain "Important" as a
        #       word in any of the searchable fields (except for the included
        #       permissions).
        #     * `resource:(instance1 OR instance2) policy:amy` to find
        #       IAM policy bindings that are set on resources "instance1" or
        #       "instance2" and also specify user "amy".
        #     * `roles:roles/compute.admin` to find IAM policy bindings that specify the
        #       Compute Admin role.
        #     * `memberTypes:user` to find IAM policy bindings that contain the "user"
        #       member type.

        #     types](https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/supported-asset-types#searchable_asset_types).
        #
        #     Regular expressions are also supported. For example:
        #
        #     * "compute.googleapis.com.*" snapshots IAM policies attached to asset type
        #     starts with "compute.googleapis.com".
        #     * ".*Instance" snapshots IAM policies attached to asset type ends with

        #     * ".*Instance.*" snapshots IAM policies attached to asset type contains
        #     "Instance".
        #
        #     See [RE2](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) for all supported
        #     regular expression syntax. If the regular expression does not match any
