        # `AccessPolicy` is a container for `AccessLevels` (which define the necessary
        # attributes to use Google Cloud services) and `ServicePerimeters` (which
        # define regions of services able to freely pass data within a perimeter). An
        # access policy is globally visible within an organization, and the
        # restrictions it specifies apply to all projects within an organization.
        # @!attribute [rw] name
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Output only. Resource name of the `AccessPolicy`. Format:
        #     `accessPolicies/{access_policy}`
        # @!attribute [rw] parent
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Required. The parent of this `AccessPolicy` in the Cloud Resource
        #     Hierarchy. Currently immutable once created. Format:
        #     `organizations/{organization_id}`
        # @!attribute [rw] title
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Required. Human readable title. Does not affect behavior.
        # @!attribute [rw] create_time
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Timestamp]
        #     Output only. Time the `AccessPolicy` was created in UTC.
        # @!attribute [rw] update_time
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Timestamp]
        #     Output only. Time the `AccessPolicy` was updated in UTC.
        # @!attribute [rw] etag
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Output only. An opaque identifier for the current version of the
        #     `AccessPolicy`. This will always be a strongly validated etag, meaning that
        #     two Access Polices will be identical if and only if their etags are
        #     identical. Clients should not expect this to be in any specific format.
