        # `ServicePerimeter` describes a set of Google Cloud resources which can freely
        # import and export data amongst themselves, but not export outside of the
        # `ServicePerimeter`. If a request with a source within this `ServicePerimeter`
        # has a target outside of the `ServicePerimeter`, the request will be blocked.
        # Otherwise the request is allowed. There are two types of Service Perimeter -
        # Regular and Bridge. Regular Service Perimeters cannot overlap, a single
        # Google Cloud project can only belong to a single regular Service Perimeter.
        # Service Perimeter Bridges can contain only Google Cloud projects as members,
        # a single Google Cloud project may belong to multiple Service Perimeter
        # Bridges.

        #     perimeter bridges. A project cannot be a included in a perimeter bridge
        #     without being included in regular perimeter. For perimeter bridges,

        #     provide a configuration ("spec") to use in a dry-run version of the Service
        #     Perimeter. This allows the user to test changes to the enforced config
        #     ("status") without actually enforcing them. This testing is done through
        #     analyzing the differences between currently enforced and suggested
        #     restrictions. use_explicit_dry_run_spec must bet set to True if any of the
        #     fields in the spec are set to non-default values.
