        # Make sure your tasks have enough resources to successfully run.
        # If you also define the types of resources for a job to use with the
        # [InstancePolicyOrTemplate](https://cloud.google.com/batch/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.jobs#instancepolicyortemplate)
        # field, make sure both fields are compatible with each other.
        # @!attribute [rw] cpu_milli
        #   @return [::Integer]
        #     The milliCPU count.
        #
        #     `cpuMilli` defines the amount of CPU resources per task in milliCPU units.
        #     For example, `1000` corresponds to 1 vCPU per task. If undefined, the
        #     default value is `2000`.
        #
        #     If you also define the VM's machine type using the `machineType` in

        #     other and with how many tasks you want to allow to run on the same VM at
        #     the same time.
        #
        #     For example, if you specify the `n2-standard-2` machine type, which has 2
        #     vCPUs each, you are recommended to set `cpuMilli` no more than `2000`, or
        #     you are recommended to run two tasks on the same VM if you set `cpuMilli`
        #     to `1000` or less.
