These settings are inherited by their descendants in the resource hierarchy. Each setting is created and managed by Google. Note that google-cloud-resource_settings-v1 is a version-specific client library. For most uses, we recommend installing the main client library google-cloud-resource_settings instead. See the readme for more details.",
