        #
        #     If a glossary was provided, then the output URI for the glossary

        #     For every single input document (for example, gs://a/b/c.[extension]), we
        #     generate at most 2 * n output files. (n is the # of target_language_codes
        #     in the BatchTranslateDocumentRequest).
        #
        #     While the input documents are being processed, we write/update an index
        #     file `index.csv` under `gcs_destination.output_uri_prefix` (for example,
        #     gs://translation_output/index.csv) The index file is generated/updated as
        #     new files are being translated. The format is:
        #
        #     input_document,target_language_code,translation_output,error_output,
        #     glossary_translation_output,glossary_error_output
        #
        #     `input_document` is one file we matched using gcs_source.input_uri.
        #     `target_language_code` is provided in the request.
        #     `translation_output` contains the translations. (details provided below)
        #     `error_output` contains the error message during processing of the file.
        #     Both translations_file and errors_file could be empty strings if we have
        #     no content to output.
        #     `glossary_translation_output` and `glossary_error_output` are the
        #     translated output/error when we apply glossaries. They could also be
        #     empty if we have no content to output.
        #
        #     Once a row is present in index.csv, the input/output matching never
        #     changes. Callers should also expect all the content in input_file are
        #     processed and ready to be consumed (that is, no partial output file is
        #     written).
        #
        #     Since index.csv will be keeping updated during the process, please make
        #     sure there is no custom retention policy applied on the output bucket
        #     that may avoid file updating.
        #     (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/bucket-lock?hl=en#retention-policy)
        #
        #     The naming format of translation output files follows (for target

        #     `glossary_translation_output`:
        #     gs://translation_test/a_b_c_[trg]_glossary_translation.[extension] The
        #     output document will maintain the same file format as the input document.
        #
        #     The naming format of error output files follows (for target language code
        #     [trg]): `error_output`: gs://translation_test/a_b_c_[trg]_errors.txt
        #     `glossary_error_output`:
        #     gs://translation_test/a_b_c_[trg]_glossary_translation.txt The error
