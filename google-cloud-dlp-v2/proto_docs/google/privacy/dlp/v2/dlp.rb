        #     characters comprising the surrogate. The following scheme defines the
        #     format: \\{info type name}(\\{surrogate character count}):\\{surrogate}
        #
        #     For example, if the name of custom info type is 'MY_TOKEN_INFO_TYPE' and

        #
        #     This annotation identifies the surrogate when inspecting content using the
        #     custom info type 'Surrogate'. This facilitates reversal of the
        #     surrogate when it occurs in free text.
        #
        #     Note: For record transformations where the entire cell in a table is being

        #     form text.
        #
        #     In order for inspection to work properly, the name of this info type must
        #     not occur naturally anywhere in your data; otherwise, inspection may either
        #
        #     - reverse a surrogate that does not correspond to an actual identifier
        #     - be unable to parse the surrogate and result in an error

        #     Therefore, choose your custom info type name carefully after considering
        #     what your data looks like. One way to select a name that has a high chance
        #     of yielding reliable detection is to include one or more unicode characters
        #     that are highly improbable to exist in your data.
