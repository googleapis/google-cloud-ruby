        #     the name of the custom info type followed by the number of
        #     characters comprising the surrogate. The following scheme defines the
        #     format: \\{info type name}(\\{surrogate character count}):\\{surrogate}
        #
        #     For example, if the name of custom info type is 'MY_TOKEN_INFO_TYPE' and
        #     the surrogate is 'abc', the full replacement value
        #     will be: 'MY_TOKEN_INFO_TYPE(3):abc'
        #
        #     This annotation identifies the surrogate when inspecting content using the
        #     custom info type 'Surrogate'. This facilitates reversal of the
        #     surrogate when it occurs in free text.
        #
        #     Note: For record transformations where the entire cell in a table is being
        #     transformed, surrogates are not mandatory. Surrogates are used to denote
        #     the location of the token and are necessary for re-identification in free
        #     form text.
        #
        #     In order for inspection to work properly, the name of this info type must
        #     not occur naturally anywhere in your data; otherwise, inspection may either
        #
        #     - reverse a surrogate that does not correspond to an actual identifier
        #     - be unable to parse the surrogate and result in an error
        #
        #     Therefore, choose your custom info type name carefully after considering
        #     what your data looks like. One way to select a name that has a high chance
        #     of yielding reliable detection is to include one or more unicode characters
        #     that are highly improbable to exist in your data.
        #     For example, assuming your data is entered from a regular ASCII keyboard,
        #     the symbol with the hex code point 29DD might be used like so:
