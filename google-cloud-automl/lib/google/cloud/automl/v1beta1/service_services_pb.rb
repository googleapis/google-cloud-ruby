    # The resource names are assigned by the server.
    # The server never reuses names that it has created after the resources with
    # those names are deleted.
    #
    # An ID of a resource is the last element of the item's resource name. For
    # `projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/datasets/{dataset_id}`, then
    # the id for the item is `{dataset_id}`.
    #
    # Currently the only supported `location_id` is "us-central1".
    #
    # On any input that is documented to expect a string parameter in
    # snake_case or kebab-case, either of those cases is accepted.
