# gcloud

#### The `gcloud` gem and `Gcloud` namespace are now deprecated.

The current `gcloud` gem exists only to facilitate the timely transition of
legacy code from the deprecated `Gcloud` namespace to the new `Google::Cloud`
namespace. Please see the [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-ruby) for more
information about using the `google-cloud` umbrella gem and the individual
service gems.

security maintenance, and not end of life. Currently, this means Ruby 2.4 and
later. Older versions of Ruby _may_ still work, but are unsupported and not
recommended. See https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/branches/ for details
about the Ruby support schedule.
