module Google
  module Longrunning
    # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a
    # network API call.
    # @!attribute [rw] name
    #   @return [::String]
    #     The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that
    #     originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the
    #     `name` should have the format of `operations/some/unique/name`.
    # @!attribute [rw] metadata
    #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Any]
    #     Service-specific metadata associated with the operation.  It typically
    #     contains progress information and common metadata such as create time.
    #     Some services might not provide such metadata.  Any method that returns a
    #     long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    # @!attribute [rw] done
    #   @return [::Boolean]
    #     If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress.
    #     If true, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is
    #     available.
    # @!attribute [rw] error
    #   @return [::Google::Rpc::Status]
    #     The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    # @!attribute [rw] response
    #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Any]
    #     The normal response of the operation in case of success.  If the original
    #     method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is
    #     `google.protobuf.Empty`.  If the original method is standard
    #     `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource.  For other
    #     methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx`
    #     is the original method name.  For example, if the original method name
    #     is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is
    #     `TakeSnapshotResponse`.

    #     };
    #   }
    # @!attribute [rw] response_type
    #   @return [::String]
    #     Required. The message name of the primary return type for this
    #     long-running operation.
    #     This type will be used to deserialize the LRO's response.
    #
    #     If the response is in a different package from the rpc, a fully-qualified
    #     message name must be used (e.g. `google.protobuf.Struct`).
    #
    #     Note: Altering this value constitutes a breaking change.
    # @!attribute [rw] metadata_type
    #   @return [::String]
    #     Required. The message name of the metadata type for this long-running
    #     operation.
    #
    #     If the response is in a different package from the rpc, a fully-qualified
    #     message name must be used (e.g. `google.protobuf.Struct`).
