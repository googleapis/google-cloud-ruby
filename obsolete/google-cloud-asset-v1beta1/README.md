# Ruby Client for the Cloud Asset V1beta1 API

API Client library for the Cloud Asset V1beta1 API

A metadata inventory service that allows you to view, monitor, and analyze all your GCP and Anthos assets across projects and services.

https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-ruby

## Installation

```
$ gem install google-cloud-asset-v1beta1
```

## Before You Begin

In order to use this library, you first need to go through the following steps:

1. [Select or create a Cloud Platform project.](https://console.cloud.google.com/project)
1. [Enable billing for your project.](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project#enable_billing_for_a_project)
1. [Enable the API.](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/cloudasset.googleapis.com)
1. {file:AUTHENTICATION.md Set up authentication.}

## Quick Start

```ruby
require "google/cloud/asset/v1beta1"

client = ::Google::Cloud::Asset::V1beta1::AssetService::Client.new
request = my_create_request
response = client.export_assets request
```

View the [Client Library Documentation](https://googleapis.dev/ruby/google-cloud-asset-v1beta1/latest)
for class and method documentation.

See also the [Product Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/)
for general usage information.

## Enabling Logging

To enable logging for this library, set the logger for the underlying [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/tree/master/src/ruby) library.
The logger that you set may be a Ruby stdlib [`Logger`](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/logger/rdoc/Logger.html) as shown below,
or a [`Google::Cloud::Logging::Logger`](https://googleapis.dev/ruby/google-cloud-logging/latest)
that will write logs to [Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging/). See [grpc/logconfig.rb](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/ruby/lib/grpc/logconfig.rb)
and the gRPC [spec_helper.rb](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/ruby/spec/spec_helper.rb) for additional information.

Configuring a Ruby stdlib logger:

```ruby
require "logger"

module MyLogger
  LOGGER = Logger.new $stderr, level: Logger::WARN
  def logger
    LOGGER
  end
end

# Define a gRPC module-level logger method before grpc/logconfig.rb loads.
module GRPC
  extend MyLogger
end
```

## Supported Ruby Versions

This library is supported on Ruby 2.4+.

Google provides official support for Ruby versions that are actively supported
by Ruby Coreâ€”that is, Ruby versions that are either in normal maintenance or
in security maintenance, and not end of life. Currently, this means Ruby 2.4
and later. Older versions of Ruby _may_ still work, but are unsupported and not
recommended. See https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/branches/ for details
about the Ruby support schedule.
