# Snippet for the list_resources call in the Config service
#
# This is an auto-generated example demonstrating basic usage of
# Google::Cloud::Config::V1::Config::Client#list_resources. It may require
# modification in order to execute successfully.
#
def list_resources
  # Create a client object. The client can be reused for multiple calls.
  client = Google::Cloud::Config::V1::Config::Client.new

  # Create a request. To set request fields, pass in keyword arguments.
  request = Google::Cloud::Config::V1::ListResourcesRequest.new

  # Call the list_resources method.
  result = client.list_resources request

  # The returned object is of type Gapic::PagedEnumerable. You can iterate
  # over elements, and API calls will be issued to fetch pages as needed.
