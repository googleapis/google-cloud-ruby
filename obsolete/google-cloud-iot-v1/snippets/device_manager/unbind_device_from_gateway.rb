# Snippet for the unbind_device_from_gateway call in the DeviceManager service
#
# This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code
# template only. It will require modifications to work:
# - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
# - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service
# client as shown in https://cloud.google.com/ruby/docs/reference.
#
# This is an auto-generated example demonstrating basic usage of
# Google::Cloud::Iot::V1::DeviceManager::Client#unbind_device_from_gateway.
#
def unbind_device_from_gateway
  # Create a client object. The client can be reused for multiple calls.
  client = Google::Cloud::Iot::V1::DeviceManager::Client.new

  # Create a request. To set request fields, pass in keyword arguments.
  request = Google::Cloud::Iot::V1::UnbindDeviceFromGatewayRequest.new

  # Call the unbind_device_from_gateway method.
  result = client.unbind_device_from_gateway request

  # The returned object is of type Google::Cloud::Iot::V1::UnbindDeviceFromGatewayResponse.
  p result
