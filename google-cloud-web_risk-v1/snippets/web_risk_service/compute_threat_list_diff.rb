# Snippet for the compute_threat_list_diff call in the WebRiskService service
#
# This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code
# template only. It will require modifications to work:
# - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
# - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service
# client as shown in https://cloud.google.com/ruby/docs/reference.
#
# This is an auto-generated example demonstrating basic usage of
# Google::Cloud::WebRisk::V1::WebRiskService::Client#compute_threat_list_diff.
#
def compute_threat_list_diff
  # Create a client object. The client can be reused for multiple calls.
  client = Google::Cloud::WebRisk::V1::WebRiskService::Client.new

  # Create a request. To set request fields, pass in keyword arguments.
  request = Google::Cloud::WebRisk::V1::ComputeThreatListDiffRequest.new

  # Call the compute_threat_list_diff method.
  result = client.compute_threat_list_diff request

  # The returned object is of type Google::Cloud::WebRisk::V1::ComputeThreatListDiffResponse.
  p result
