It offers users visibility into upcoming, ongoing, and completed maintenance, along with controls to manage certain maintenance activities, such as mainteance windows, rescheduling, and on-demand updates. Note that google-cloud-maintenance-api-v1beta is a version-specific client library. For most uses, we recommend installing the main client library google-cloud-maintenance-api instead. See the readme for more details.",
