# Snippet for the get_page call in the Pages service
#
# This snippet has been automatically generated and should be regarded as a code
# template only. It will require modifications to work:
# - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
# - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service
# client as shown in https://cloud.google.com/ruby/docs/reference.
#
# This is an auto-generated example demonstrating basic usage of
# Google::Cloud::Dialogflow::CX::V3::Pages::Client#get_page.
#
def get_page
  # Create a client object. The client can be reused for multiple calls.
  client = Google::Cloud::Dialogflow::CX::V3::Pages::Client.new

  # Create a request. To set request fields, pass in keyword arguments.
  request = Google::Cloud::Dialogflow::CX::V3::GetPageRequest.new

  # Call the get_page method.
  result = client.get_page request

  # The returned object is of type Google::Cloud::Dialogflow::CX::V3::Page.
  p result
