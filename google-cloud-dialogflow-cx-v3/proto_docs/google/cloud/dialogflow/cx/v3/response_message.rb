          # Represents a response message that can be returned by a conversational agent.
          #
          # Response messages are also used for output audio synthesis. The approach is
          # as follows:
          #
          # * If at least one OutputAudioText response is present, then all
          #   OutputAudioText responses are linearly concatenated, and the result is used
          #   for output audio synthesis.
          # * If the OutputAudioText responses are a mixture of text and SSML, then the
          #   concatenated result is treated as SSML; otherwise, the result is treated as
          #   either text or SSML as appropriate. The agent designer should ideally use
          #   either text or SSML consistently throughout the bot design.
          # * Otherwise, all Text responses are linearly concatenated, and the result is
          #   used for output audio synthesis.
          #
          # This approach allows for more sophisticated user experience scenarios, where
          # the text displayed to the user may differ from what is heard.
