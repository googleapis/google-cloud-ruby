        # configuration at one folder overrides any other configurations in its
        # ancestry. Setting a configuration on a folder is a prerequisite for Cloud KMS
        # Autokey, so that users working in a descendant project can request
        # provisioned {::Google::Cloud::Kms::V1::CryptoKey CryptoKeys}, ready for Customer
        # Managed Encryption Key (CMEK) use, on-demand.
