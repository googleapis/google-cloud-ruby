      # By default, this returns an instance of

      # However, you can specify specify a different API version by passing it in the

      # supported by that API version, and the corresponding gem is available, the
      # appropriate versioned client will be returned.

      # ## About CertificateManager
      #
      # API Overview
      #
      # Certificates Manager API allows customers to see and manage all their TLS
      # certificates.
      #
      # Certificates Manager API service provides methods to manage certificates,
      # group them into collections, and create serving configuration that can be
      # easily applied to other Cloud resources e.g. Target Proxies.
      #
      # Data Model
      #
      # The Certificates Manager service exposes the following resources:
      #
      # * `Certificate` which describes a single TLS certificate.
      # * `CertificateMap` which describes a collection of certificates that can be
      # attached to a target resource.
      # * `CertificateMapEntry` which describes a single configuration entry that
      # consists of a SNI and a group of certificates. It's a subresource of
      # CertificateMap.
      #
      # Certificate, CertificateMap and CertificateMapEntry IDs
      # have to match "^[a-z0-9-]\\{1,63}$" regexp, which means that
      # - only lower case letters, digits, and hyphen are allowed
      # - length of the resource ID has to be in [1,63] range.
      #
      # Provides methods to manage Cloud Certificate Manager entities.
      #
      # @param version [::String, ::Symbol] The API version to connect to. Optional.
      #   Defaults to `:v1`.
      # @return [CertificateManager::Client] A client object for the specified version.

      #   Hash, or a Google::Auth::Credentials object.
      # * `lib_name` (*type:* `String`) -
      #   The library name as recorded in instrumentation and logging.
      # * `lib_version` (*type:* `String`) -
      #   The library version as recorded in instrumentation and logging.
      # * `interceptors` (*type:* `Array<GRPC::ClientInterceptor>`) -
      #   An array of interceptors that are run before calls are executed.
      # * `timeout` (*type:* `Numeric`) -
      #   Default timeout in seconds.
      # * `metadata` (*type:* `Hash{Symbol=>String}`) -
      #   Additional gRPC headers to be sent with the call.
      # * `retry_policy` (*type:* `Hash`) -
      #   The retry policy. The value is a hash with the following keys:
      #     * `:initial_delay` (*type:* `Numeric`) - The initial delay in seconds.
      #     * `:max_delay` (*type:* `Numeric`) - The max delay in seconds.
      #     * `:multiplier` (*type:* `Numeric`) - The incremental backoff multiplier.
