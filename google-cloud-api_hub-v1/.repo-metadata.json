API hub lets you capture critical information about APIs that allows developers to discover and evaluate them easily and leverage the work of other teams wherever possible. API platform teams can use API hub to have visibility into and manage their portfolio of APIs. Note that google-cloud-api_hub-v1 is a version-specific client library. For most uses, we recommend installing the main client library google-cloud-api_hub instead. See the readme for more details.",
