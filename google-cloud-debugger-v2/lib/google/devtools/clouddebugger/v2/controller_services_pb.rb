          # The Controller service provides the API for orchestrating a collection of
          # debugger agents to perform debugging tasks. These agents are each attached
          # to a process of an application which may include one or more replicas.
          #
          # The debugger agents register with the Controller to identify the application
          # being debugged, the Debuggee. All agents that register with the same data,
          # represent the same Debuggee, and are assigned the same `debuggee_id`.
          #
          # The debugger agents call the Controller to retrieve  the list of active
          # Breakpoints. Agents with the same `debuggee_id` get the same breakpoints
          # list. An agent that can fulfill the breakpoint request updates the
          # Controller with the breakpoint result. The controller selects the first
          # result received and discards the rest of the results.
          # Agents that poll again for active breakpoints will no longer have
          # the completed breakpoint in the list and should remove that breakpoint from
          # their attached process.
          #
          # The Controller service does not provide a way to retrieve the results of
          # a completed breakpoint. This functionality is available using the Debugger
          # service.

            # doesn't change the breakpoint semantics.
            #
            # This means that an agent does not need to check if a breakpoint has changed
            # when it encounters the same breakpoint on a successive call.
            # Moreover, an agent should remember the breakpoints that are completed

            # setting those breakpoints again.

            # or snapping the location to the correct line of code.
