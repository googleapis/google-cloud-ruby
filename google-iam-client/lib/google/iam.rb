# Require this file early so that the version constant gets defined before

    # Create a new client object for Policies.
    #
    # By default, this returns an instance of
    # [Google::Iam::V2::Policies::Client](https://googleapis.dev/ruby/google-iam-v2/latest/Google/Iam/V2/Policies/Client.html)
    # for a gRPC client for version V2 of the API.
    # However, you can specify a different API version by passing it in the
    # `version` parameter. If the Policies service is
    # supported by that API version, and the corresponding gem is available, the
    # appropriate versioned client will be returned.
    # You can also specify a different transport by passing `:rest` or `:grpc` in
    # the `transport` parameter.
    #
    # ## About Policies
    #
    # An interface for managing Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies.
    #
    # @param version [::String, ::Symbol] The API version to connect to. Optional.
    #   Defaults to `:v2`.
    # @param transport [:grpc, :rest] The transport to use. Defaults to `:grpc`.
    # @return [::Object] A client object for the specified version.
