    # Monitoring configuration of the service.
    #
    # The example below shows how to configure monitored resources and metrics
    # for monitoring. In the example, a monitored resource and two metrics are
    # defined. The `library.googleapis.com/book/returned_count` metric is sent
    # to both producer and consumer projects, whereas the
    # `library.googleapis.com/book/overdue_count` metric is only sent to the
    # consumer project.
    #
    #     monitored_resources:
    #     - type: library.googleapis.com/branch
    #       labels:
    #       - key: /city
    #         description: The city where the library branch is located in.
    #       - key: /name
    #         description: The name of the branch.
    #     metrics:
    #     - name: library.googleapis.com/book/returned_count
    #       metric_kind: DELTA
    #       value_type: INT64
    #       labels:
    #       - key: /customer_id
    #     - name: library.googleapis.com/book/overdue_count
    #       metric_kind: GAUGE
