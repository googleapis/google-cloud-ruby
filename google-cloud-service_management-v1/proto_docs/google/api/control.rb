    # Example:
    #
    #     control:
    #       environment: servicecontrol.googleapis.com
    # @!attribute [rw] environment
    #   @return [::String]
    #     The service controller environment to use. If empty, no control plane
    #     feature (like quota and billing) will be enabled. The recommended value for
    #     most services is servicecontrol.googleapis.com
