    # Quota configuration helps to achieve fairness and budgeting in service
    # usage.
    #
    # The quota configuration works this way:
    # - The service configuration defines a set of metrics.
    # - For API calls, the quota.metric_rules maps methods to metrics with
    #   corresponding costs.
    # - The quota.limits defines limits on the metrics, which will be used for
    #   quota checks at runtime.
    #
    # An example quota configuration in yaml format:
    #
    #    quota:
    #      limits:
    #
    #      - name: apiWriteQpsPerProject
    #        metric: library.googleapis.com/write_calls
    #        unit: "1/min/\\{project}"  # rate limit for consumer projects
    #        values:
    #          STANDARD: 10000
    #
    #      # The metric rules bind all methods to the read_calls metric,
    #      # except for the UpdateBook and DeleteBook methods. These two methods
    #      # are mapped to the write_calls metric, with the UpdateBook method
    #      # consuming at twice rate as the DeleteBook method.
    #      metric_rules:
    #      - selector: "*"
    #        metric_costs:
    #          library.googleapis.com/read_calls: 1
    #      - selector: google.example.library.v1.LibraryService.UpdateBook
    #        metric_costs:
    #          library.googleapis.com/write_calls: 2
    #      - selector: google.example.library.v1.LibraryService.DeleteBook
    #        metric_costs:

    # `QuotaLimit` defines a specific limit that applies over a specified duration
    # for a limit type. There can be at most one limit for a duration and limit
    # type combination defined within a `QuotaGroup`.
    # @!attribute [rw] name
    #   @return [::String]
    #     Name of the quota limit. The name is used to refer to the limit when
    #     overriding the default limit on per-consumer basis.
    #
    #     For group-based quota limits, the name must be unique within the quota
    #     group. If a name is not provided, it will be generated from the limit_by
    #     and duration fields.
    #
    #     For metric-based quota limits, the name must be provided, and it must be
    #     unique within the service. The name can only include alphanumeric
    #     characters as well as '-'.
    #
    #     The maximum length of the limit name is 64 characters.
    #
    #     The name of a limit is used as a unique identifier for this limit.
    #     Therefore, once a limit has been put into use, its name should be
    #     immutable. You can use the display_name field to provide a user-friendly
    #     name for the limit. The display name can be evolved over time without
    #     affecting the identity of the limit.
    # @!attribute [rw] description
    #   @return [::String]
    #     Optional. User-visible, extended description for this quota limit.
    #     Should be used only when more context is needed to understand this limit
    #     than provided by the limit's display name (see: `display_name`).
    # @!attribute [rw] default_limit
    #   @return [::Integer]
    #     Default number of tokens that can be consumed during the specified
    #     duration. This is the number of tokens assigned when a client
    #     application developer activates the service for his/her project.
    #
    #     Specifying a value of 0 will block all requests. This can be used if you
    #     are provisioning quota to selected consumers and blocking others.
    #     Similarly, a value of -1 will indicate an unlimited quota. No other
    #     negative values are allowed.
    #
    #     Used by group-based quotas only.
    # @!attribute [rw] max_limit
    #   @return [::Integer]
    #     Maximum number of tokens that can be consumed during the specified
    #     duration. Client application developers can override the default limit up
    #     to this maximum. If specified, this value cannot be set to a value less
    #     than the default limit. If not specified, it is set to the default limit.
    #
    #     To allow clients to apply overrides with no upper bound, set this to -1,
    #     indicating unlimited maximum quota.
    #
    #     Used by group-based quotas only.
    # @!attribute [rw] free_tier
    #   @return [::Integer]
    #     Free tier value displayed in the Developers Console for this limit.
    #     The free tier is the number of tokens that will be subtracted from the
    #     billed amount when billing is enabled.
    #     This field can only be set on a limit with duration "1d", in a billable
    #     group; it is invalid on any other limit. If this field is not set, it
    #     defaults to 0, indicating that there is no free tier for this service.
    #
    #     Used by group-based quotas only.
    # @!attribute [rw] duration
    #   @return [::String]
    #     Duration of this limit in textual notation. Example: "100s", "24h", "1d".
    #     For duration longer than a day, only multiple of days is supported. We
    #     support only "100s" and "1d" for now. Additional support will be added in
    #     the future. "0" indicates indefinite duration.
    #
    #     Used by group-based quotas only.
    # @!attribute [rw] metric
    #   @return [::String]
    #     The name of the metric this quota limit applies to. The quota limits with
    #     the same metric will be checked together during runtime. The metric must be
    #     defined within the service config.
    #
    #     Used by metric-based quotas only.
    # @!attribute [rw] unit
    #   @return [::String]
    #     Specify the unit of the quota limit. It uses the same syntax as
    #     [Metric.unit][]. The supported unit kinds are determined by the quota
    #     backend system.
    #
    #     The [Google Service Control](https://cloud.google.com/service-control)
    #     supports the following unit components:
    #     * One of the time intevals:
    #       * "/min"  for quota every minute.
    #       * "/d"  for quota every 24 hours, starting 00:00 US Pacific Time.
    #       * Otherwise the quota won't be reset by time, such as storage limit.
    #     * One and only one of the granted containers:
    #       * "/\\{organization}" quota for an organization.
    #       * "/\\{project}" quota for a project.
    #       * "/\\{folder}" quota for a folder.
    #       * "/\\{resource}" quota for a universal resource.
    #     * Zero or more quota segmentation dimension. Not all combos are valid.
    #       * "/\\{region}" quota for every region. Not to be used with time intervals.
    #       * Otherwise the resources granted on the target is not segmented.
    #       * "/\\{zone}" quota for every zone. Not to be used with time intervals.
    #       * Otherwise the resources granted on the target is not segmented.
    #       * "/\\{resource}" quota for a resource associated with a project or org.
    #
    #     Here are some examples:
    #     * "1/min/\\{project}" for quota per minute per project.
    #     * "1/min/\\{user}" for quota per minute per user.
    #     * "1/min/\\{organization}" for quota per minute per organization.
    #
    #     Note: the order of unit components is insignificant.
    #     The "1" at the beginning is required to follow the metric unit syntax.
    #
    #     Used by metric-based quotas only.
    # @!attribute [rw] values
    #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Map{::String => ::Integer}]
    #     Tiered limit values. Also allows for regional or zone overrides for these
    #     values if "/\\{region}" or "/\\{zone}" is specified in the unit field.
    #
    #     Currently supported tiers from low to high:
    #     VERY_LOW, LOW, STANDARD, HIGH, VERY_HIGH
    #
    #     To apply different limit values for users according to their tiers, specify
    #     the values for the tiers you want to differentiate. For example:
    #     \\{LOW:100, STANDARD:500, HIGH:1000, VERY_HIGH:5000}
    #
    #     The limit value for each tier is optional except for the tier STANDARD.
    #     The limit value for an unspecified tier falls to the value of its next
    #     tier towards tier STANDARD. For the above example, the limit value for tier
    #     STANDARD is 500.
    #
    #     To apply the same limit value for all users, just specify limit value for
    #     tier STANDARD. For example: \\{STANDARD:500}.
    #
    #     To apply a regional overide for a tier, add a map entry with key
    #     "<TIER>/<region>", where <region> is a region name. Similarly, for a zone
    #     override, add a map entry with key "<TIER>/\\{zone}".
    #     Further, a wildcard can be used at the end of a zone name in order to
    #     specify zone level overrides. For example:
    #     LOW: 10, STANDARD: 50, HIGH: 100,
    #     LOW/us-central1: 20, STANDARD/us-central1: 60, HIGH/us-central1: 200,
    #     LOW/us-central1-*: 10, STANDARD/us-central1-*: 20, HIGH/us-central1-*: 80
    #
    #     The regional overrides tier set for each region must be the same as
    #     the tier set for default limit values. Same rule applies for zone overrides
    #     tier as well.
    #
    #     Used by metric-based quotas only.
    # @!attribute [rw] display_name
    #   @return [::String]
    #     User-visible display name for this limit.
    #     Optional. If not set, the UI will provide a default display name based on
    #     the quota configuration. This field can be used to override the default
    #     display name generated from the configuration.
