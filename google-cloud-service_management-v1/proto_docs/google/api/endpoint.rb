module Google
  module Api
    # `Endpoint` describes a network address of a service that serves a set of
    # APIs. It is commonly known as a service endpoint. A service may expose
    # any number of service endpoints, and all service endpoints share the same
    # service definition, such as quota limits and monitoring metrics.
    #
    # Example:
    #
    #     type: google.api.Service
    #     name: library-example.googleapis.com
    #     endpoints:
    #       # Declares network address `https://library-example.googleapis.com`
    #       # for service `library-example.googleapis.com`. The `https` scheme
    #       # is implicit for all service endpoints. Other schemes may be
    #       # supported in the future.
    #     - name: library-example.googleapis.com
    #       allow_cors: false
    #     - name: content-staging-library-example.googleapis.com
    #       # Allows HTTP OPTIONS calls to be passed to the API frontend, for it
    #       # to decide whether the subsequent cross-origin request is allowed
    #       # to proceed.
    #       allow_cors: true
    # @!attribute [rw] name
    #   @return [::String]
    #     The canonical name of this endpoint.
    # @!attribute [rw] aliases
    #   @deprecated This field is deprecated and may be removed in the next major version update.
    #   @return [::Array<::String>]
    #     Unimplemented. Dot not use.
    #
    #     DEPRECATED: This field is no longer supported. Instead of using aliases,
    #     please specify multiple {::Google::Api::Endpoint google.api.Endpoint} for each
    #     of the intended aliases.
    #
    #     Additional names that this endpoint will be hosted on.
    # @!attribute [rw] target
    #   @return [::String]
    #     The specification of an Internet routable address of API frontend that will
    #     handle requests to this [API
    #     Endpoint](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/glossary). It should be
    #     either a valid IPv4 address or a fully-qualified domain name. For example,
    #     "8.8.8.8" or "myservice.appspot.com".
    # @!attribute [rw] allow_cors
    #   @return [::Boolean]
    #     Allowing
    #     [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing), aka
    #     cross-domain traffic, would allow the backends served from this endpoint to
    #     receive and respond to HTTP OPTIONS requests. The response will be used by
    #     the browser to determine whether the subsequent cross-origin request is
    #     allowed to proceed.
