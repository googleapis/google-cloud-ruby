    module Logging
      module V2
        # An individual entry in a log.
        # @!attribute [rw] log_name
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Required. The resource name of the log to which this log entry belongs:
        #
        #         "projects/[PROJECT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]"
        #         "organizations/[ORGANIZATION_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]"
        #         "billingAccounts/[BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]"
        #         "folders/[FOLDER_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]"
        #
        #     A project number may be used in place of PROJECT_ID. The project number is
        #     translated to its corresponding PROJECT_ID internally and the `log_name`
        #     field will contain PROJECT_ID in queries and exports.
        #
        #     `[LOG_ID]` must be URL-encoded within `log_name`. Example:
        #     `"organizations/1234567890/logs/cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com%2Factivity"`.
        #
        #     `[LOG_ID]` must be less than 512 characters long and can only include the
        #     following characters: upper and lower case alphanumeric characters,
        #     forward-slash, underscore, hyphen, and period.
        #
        #     For backward compatibility, if `log_name` begins with a forward-slash, such
        #     as `/projects/...`, then the log entry is ingested as usual, but the
        #     forward-slash is removed. Listing the log entry will not show the leading
        #     slash and filtering for a log name with a leading slash will never return
        #     any results.
        # @!attribute [rw] resource
        #   @return [::Google::Api::MonitoredResource]
        #     Required. The monitored resource that produced this log entry.
        #
        #     Example: a log entry that reports a database error would be associated with
        #     the monitored resource designating the particular database that reported
        #     the error.
        # @!attribute [rw] proto_payload
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Any]
        #     The log entry payload, represented as a protocol buffer. Some Google
        #     Cloud Platform services use this field for their log entry payloads.
        #
        #     The following protocol buffer types are supported; user-defined types
        #     are not supported:
        #
        #       "type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.audit.AuditLog"
        #       "type.googleapis.com/google.appengine.logging.v1.RequestLog"
        # @!attribute [rw] text_payload
        #   @return [::String]
        #     The log entry payload, represented as a Unicode string (UTF-8).
        # @!attribute [rw] json_payload
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Struct]
        #     The log entry payload, represented as a structure that is
        #     expressed as a JSON object.
        # @!attribute [rw] timestamp
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Timestamp]
        #     Optional. The time the event described by the log entry occurred. This time is used
        #     to compute the log entry's age and to enforce the logs retention period.
        #     If this field is omitted in a new log entry, then Logging assigns it the
        #     current time. Timestamps have nanosecond accuracy, but trailing zeros in
        #     the fractional seconds might be omitted when the timestamp is displayed.
        #
        #     Incoming log entries must have timestamps that don't exceed the
        #     [logs retention
        #     period](https://cloud.google.com/logging/quotas#logs_retention_periods) in
        #     the past, and that don't exceed 24 hours in the future. Log entries outside
        #     those time boundaries aren't ingested by Logging.
        # @!attribute [r] receive_timestamp
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Timestamp]
        #     Output only. The time the log entry was received by Logging.
        # @!attribute [rw] severity
        #   @return [::Google::Cloud::Logging::Type::LogSeverity]
        #     Optional. The severity of the log entry. The default value is `LogSeverity.DEFAULT`.
        # @!attribute [rw] insert_id
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Optional. A unique identifier for the log entry. If you provide a value, then
        #     Logging considers other log entries in the same project, with the same
        #     `timestamp`, and with the same `insert_id` to be duplicates which are
        #     removed in a single query result. However, there are no guarantees of
        #     de-duplication in the export of logs.
        #
        #     If the `insert_id` is omitted when writing a log entry, the Logging API
        #     assigns its own unique identifier in this field.
        #
        #     In queries, the `insert_id` is also used to order log entries that have
        #     the same `log_name` and `timestamp` values.
        # @!attribute [rw] http_request
        #   @return [::Google::Cloud::Logging::Type::HttpRequest]
        #     Optional. Information about the HTTP request associated with this log entry, if
        #     applicable.
        # @!attribute [rw] labels
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Map{::String => ::String}]
        #     Optional. A map of key, value pairs that provides additional information about the
        #     log entry. The labels can be user-defined or system-defined.
        #
        #     User-defined labels are arbitrary key, value pairs that you can use to
        #     classify logs.
        #
        #     System-defined labels are defined by GCP services for platform logs.
        #     They have two components - a service namespace component and the
        #     attribute name. For example: `compute.googleapis.com/resource_name`.
        #
        #     Cloud Logging truncates label keys that exceed 512 B and label
        #     values that exceed 64 KB upon their associated log entry being
        #     written. The truncation is indicated by an ellipsis at the
        #     end of the character string.
        # @!attribute [rw] operation
        #   @return [::Google::Cloud::Logging::V2::LogEntryOperation]
        #     Optional. Information about an operation associated with the log entry, if
        #     applicable.
        # @!attribute [rw] trace
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Optional. Resource name of the trace associated with the log entry, if any. If it
        #     contains a relative resource name, the name is assumed to be relative to
        #     `//tracing.googleapis.com`. Example:
        #     `projects/my-projectid/traces/06796866738c859f2f19b7cfb3214824`
        # @!attribute [rw] span_id
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Optional. The span ID within the trace associated with the log entry.
        #
        #     For Trace spans, this is the same format that the Trace API v2 uses: a
        #     16-character hexadecimal encoding of an 8-byte array, such as
        #     `000000000000004a`.
        # @!attribute [rw] trace_sampled
        #   @return [::Boolean]
        #     Optional. The sampling decision of the trace associated with the log entry.
        #
        #     True means that the trace resource name in the `trace` field was sampled
        #     for storage in a trace backend. False means that the trace was not sampled
        #     for storage when this log entry was written, or the sampling decision was
        #     unknown at the time. A non-sampled `trace` value is still useful as a
        #     request correlation identifier. The default is False.
        # @!attribute [rw] source_location
        #   @return [::Google::Cloud::Logging::V2::LogEntrySourceLocation]
        #     Optional. Source code location information associated with the log entry, if any.
        # @!attribute [rw] split
        #   @return [::Google::Cloud::Logging::V2::LogSplit]
        #     Optional. Information indicating this LogEntry is part of a sequence of multiple log
        #     entries split from a single LogEntry.
        class LogEntry
          include ::Google::Protobuf::MessageExts

        #   @return [::String]
        #     Optional. An arbitrary operation identifier. Log entries with the same
        #     identifier are assumed to be part of the same operation.
        # @!attribute [rw] producer
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Optional. An arbitrary producer identifier. The combination of `id` and
        #     `producer` must be globally unique. Examples for `producer`:
        #     `"MyDivision.MyBigCompany.com"`, `"github.com/MyProject/MyApplication"`.
        # @!attribute [rw] first
        #   @return [::Boolean]
        #     Optional. Set this to True if this is the first log entry in the operation.
        # @!attribute [rw] last

        # @!attribute [rw] line
        #   @return [::Integer]

        #     Optional. Human-readable name of the function or method being invoked, with
        #     optional context such as the class or package name. This information may be
        #     used in contexts such as the logs viewer, where a file and line number are
        #     less meaningful. The format can vary by language. For example:
        #     `qual.if.ied.Class.method` (Java), `dir/package.func` (Go), `function`
        #     (Python).
