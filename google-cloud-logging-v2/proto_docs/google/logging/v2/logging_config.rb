        #     Optional. An [advanced logs
        #     filter](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/advanced-queries). The
        #     only exported log entries are those that are in the resource owning the
        #     sink and that match the filter.
        #
        #     For example:

        # @!attribute [rw] exclusions
        #   @return [::Array<::Google::Cloud::Logging::V2::LogExclusion>]

        #
        #     If a log entry is matched by both `filter` and one of `exclusion_filters`
        #     it will not be exported.

        #   @return [::String]
        #     Output only. An IAM identity&mdash;a service account or group&mdash;under which Cloud
        #     Logging writes the exported log entries to the sink's destination. This
        #     field is set by
        #     {::Google::Cloud::Logging::V2::ConfigService::Client#create_sink sinks.create} and
        #     {::Google::Cloud::Logging::V2::ConfigService::Client#update_sink sinks.update} based on the
        #     value of `unique_writer_identity` in those methods.
        #
        #     Until you grant this identity write-access to the destination, log entry
        #     exports from this sink will fail. For more information, see [Granting

        #     Resource](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-roles-to-service-accounts#granting_access_to_a_service_account_for_a_resource).
        #     Consult the destination service's documentation to determine the
        #     appropriate IAM roles to assign to the identity.
        #
        #     Sinks that have a destination that is a log bucket in the same project as
        #     the sink do not have a writer_identity and no additional permissions are

        #     resource are available for export. If the field is true, then log entries
        #     from all the projects, folders, and billing accounts contained in the
        #     sink's parent resource are also available for export. Whether a particular
        #     log entry from the children is exported depends on the sink's filter
        #     expression.
        #
        #     For example, if this field is true, then the filter
        #     `resource.type=gce_instance` would export all Compute Engine VM instance
        #     log entries from all projects in the sink's parent.
        #
        #     To only export entries from certain child projects, filter on the project
        #     part of the log name:

        #     default, Cloud Logging creates dated tables based on the log entries'

        #     is no longer present and [special query

        #
        #     All new sinks will have this field set true and will use timestamp column
