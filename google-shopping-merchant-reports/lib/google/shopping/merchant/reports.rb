        # Create a new client object for ReportService.
        #
        # By default, this returns an instance of
        # [Google::Shopping::Merchant::Reports::V1beta::ReportService::Client](https://rubydoc.info/gems/google-shopping-merchant-reports-v1beta/Google/Shopping/Merchant/Reports/V1beta/ReportService/Client)
        # for a gRPC client for version V1beta of the API.
        # However, you can specify a different API version by passing it in the
        # `version` parameter. If the ReportService service is
        # supported by that API version, and the corresponding gem is available, the
        # appropriate versioned client will be returned.
        # You can also specify a different transport by passing `:rest` or `:grpc` in
        # the `transport` parameter.
        #
        # ## About ReportService
        #
        # Service for retrieving reports and insights about your products, their
        # performance, and their competitive environment on Google.

        # @param version [::String, ::Symbol] The API version to connect to. Optional.

        # @param transport [:grpc, :rest] The transport to use. Defaults to `:grpc`.
        # @return [::Object] A client object for the specified version.
