        #     access this result set.
        #
        #     If this field is set, the service will ignore the resource and
        #     {::Google::Cloud::Talent::V4beta1::SearchProfilesRequest#profile_query profile_query} values, and simply retrieve a page of results from the

        #     or {::Google::Cloud::Talent::V4beta1::SearchProfilesRequest#offset offset} must be set.
        #
        #     A typical use case is to invoke {::Google::Cloud::Talent::V4beta1::SearchProfilesRequest SearchProfilesRequest} without this
        #     field, then use the resulting {::Google::Cloud::Talent::V4beta1::SearchProfilesRequest#result_set_id result_set_id} in
        #     {::Google::Cloud::Talent::V4beta1::SearchProfilesResponse SearchProfilesResponse} to page through the results.

        #     query "as is" when it generates a set of results. By default this flag is
        #     set to false, thus allowing expanded results to also be returned. For

        #     as a keyword.
        #
        #     It is recommended to provide a feature in the UI (such as a checkbox) to

        #     A profile summary shows the profile summary and how the profile matches the
        #     search query.
        #
        #     In profile summary, the profiles with the same {::Google::Cloud::Talent::V4beta1::Profile#group_id Profile.group_id} are
        #     merged together. Among profiles, same education/employment records may be
        #     slightly different but they are merged into one with best efforts.
        #
        #     For example, in one profile the school name is "UC Berkeley" and the field
        #     study is "Computer Science" and in another one the school name is
        #     "University of California at Berkeley" and the field study is "CS". The API
        #     merges these two inputs into one and selects one value for each field. For
        #     example, the school name in summary is set to "University of California at
        #     Berkeley" and the field of study is set to "Computer Science".
