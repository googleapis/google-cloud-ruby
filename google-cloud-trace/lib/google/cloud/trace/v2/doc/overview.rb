    # # Ruby Client for Stackdriver Trace API ([Beta](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-ruby#versioning))
    #
    # [Stackdriver Trace API][Product Documentation]:
    # Sends application trace data to Stackdriver Trace for viewing. Trace data is
    # collected for all App Engine applications by default. Trace data from other
    # applications can be provided using this API.
    # - [Product Documentation][]
    #
    # ## Quick Start
    # In order to use this library, you first need to go through the following
    # steps:
    #
    # 1. [Select or create a Cloud Platform project.](https://console.cloud.google.com/project)
    # 2. [Enable billing for your project.](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project#enable_billing_for_a_project)
    # 3. [Enable the Stackdriver Trace API.](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/trace)
    # 4. [Setup Authentication.](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-ruby/#/docs/google-cloud/master/guides/authentication)
    #
    # ### Installation
    # ```
    # $ gem install google-cloud-trace
    # ```
    #
    # ### Preview
    # #### TraceServiceClient
    # ```rb
    # require "google/cloud/trace"
    #
    # trace_service_client = Google::Cloud::Trace.new
    # formatted_name = Google::Cloud::Trace::V2::TraceServiceClient.project_path(project_id)
    #
    # # TODO: Initialize +spans+:
    # spans = []
    # trace_service_client.batch_write_spans(formatted_name, spans)
    # ```
    #
    # ### Next Steps
    # - Read the [Stackdriver Trace API Product documentation][Product Documentation]
    #   to learn more about the product and see How-to Guides.
    # - View this [repository's main README](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-ruby/blob/master/README.md)
    #   to see the full list of Cloud APIs that we cover.

    # ## Enabling Logging
    #
    # To enable logging for this library, set the logger for the underlying [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/tree/master/src/ruby) library.
    # The logger that you set may be a Ruby stdlib [`Logger`](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.5.0/libdoc/logger/rdoc/Logger.html) as shown below,
    # or a [`Google::Cloud::Logging::Logger`](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-ruby/#/docs/google-cloud-logging/latest/google/cloud/logging/logger)
    # that will write logs to [Stackdriver Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging/). See [grpc/logconfig.rb](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/ruby/lib/grpc/logconfig.rb)
    # and the gRPC [spec_helper.rb](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/ruby/spec/spec_helper.rb) for additional information.
    #
    # Configuring a Ruby stdlib logger:
    #
    # ```ruby
    # require "logger"
    #
    # module MyLogger
    #   LOGGER = Logger.new $stderr, level: Logger::WARN
    #   def logger
    #     LOGGER
    #   end
    # end
    #
    # # Define a gRPC module-level logger method before grpc/logconfig.rb loads.
    # module GRPC
    #   extend MyLogger
    # end
    # ```
    #
    module Trace
      module V2
      end
    end
  end
end
