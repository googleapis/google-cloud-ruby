Certificate Manager lets you directly and programmatically request publicly trusted TLS certificates that are already in the root of trust stores used by major browsers, operating systems, and applications. You can use these TLS certificates to authenticate and encrypt internet traffic. Note that google-cloud-security-public_ca-v1beta1 is a version-specific client library. For most uses, we recommend installing the main client library google-cloud-security-public_ca instead. See the readme for more details.",
