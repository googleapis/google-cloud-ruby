# - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service
# client as shown in https://cloud.google.com/ruby/docs/reference.

# This is an auto-generated example demonstrating basic usage of
# Google::Cloud::Security::PublicCA::V1beta1::PublicCertificateAuthorityService::Client#create_external_account_key.
